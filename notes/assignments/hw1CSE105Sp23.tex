{\bf In this assignment,}

You will practice reading and
applying the definitions of alphabets, strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions.
You will use regular expressions and relate them to languages and automata.
You will use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of DFA,
and you will use clear English to describe computations of DFA informally.


{\bf Resources}: To review the topics you are working with 
for this assignment, see the class material from Week 1.
We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a 
pinned Piazza post.

{\bf Reading and extra practice problems}: Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1.
