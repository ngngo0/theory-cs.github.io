{\bf In this assignment,}

You will practice reading and
applying the definitions of alphabets, strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions.
You will use regular expressions and relate them to languages and finite automata.

and you will use clear English to describe computations of finite automata informally.

for this assignment, see the class material from Week 1.
We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a 
pinned Piazza post.

{\bf Reading and extra practice problems}: Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1.

{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\gradeCompleteFirst \textbf{Finding examples and edge cases} (12 points):

With $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$ and 
$\Sigma_2 = \{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z\}$
and $\Gamma = \{0,1,x,y,z\}$

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give an example of the shortest string over $\Sigma_1$ that is meaningful to you in some way, and explain 
    why it's meaningful to you.

    \item List all examples of strings of length $1$ over $\Sigma_2$ and explain why your list is exhaustive.

    \item Calculate the number of distinct strings of length 3 over $\Gamma$ and explain your calculation.

    \item With the ordering $x < y < z < 0 < 1$, list the first ten strings over $\Gamma$ in string order.

    \item Give an example of a finite set that is a language over $\Sigma_1$ and over $\Sigma_2$ and over $\Gamma$, 
    or explain why there is no such set.
    
    \item  Give an example of an infinite set that is a language over $\Sigma_1$  and over $\Gamma$, 
    or explain why there is no such set.

    \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\gradeComplete \textbf{Regular expressions} (10 points):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give three regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over $\{a,b\}$ that have 
    even length. Ungraded bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!

    \item A friend tells you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star ($~^*$) describes an
    infinite language. Are they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a counterexample to disprove it
    and then fix the formula.

    \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\gradeCorrectFirst \textbf{Functions over languages} (15 points):

For languages $L_1, L_2$ over the alphabet $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$, we have the 
associated sets of strings
\[
    SUBSTRING(L_1) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ \text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma_1^* \text{ such that } awb \in L_1\}
\]
and 
\[
    L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and } v \in L_2 \}
\]
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Specify an example language $A$ over $\Sigma_1$ such that 
    $A \neq \emptyset$ and yet $\SUBSTRING(A) = \emptyset$, 
    or explain why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $A$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $\SUBSTRING(A)$ using relevant definitions 
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality with 
    $\emptyset$, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item Specify example languages $B, C$ over $\Sigma_1$ such that 
    $B \neq \Sigma_1^*$ and $C \neq \Sigma_1^*$ and yet $B \circ C = \Sigma_1^*$, 
    or explain why there are no such examples. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example languages $B,C$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $B \circ C$ using relevant definitions 
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality with 
    $\Sigma_1^*$, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item Specify example {\bf finite} languages $L_1, L_2$ over $\Sigma_1$ such that 
    $L_1 \circ L_2 \neq L_1$ but $|L_1 \circ L_2| = |L_1|$, or 
    explain why there are no such examples.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example languages $L_1, L_2$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $L_1 \circ L_2$ using relevant definitions 
    to justify this description and to justify the cardinality claims and set (in)equality claims, 
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.
    \end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\gradeCorrect \textbf{Finite automata} (13 points):

Consider the finite automaton $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ whose state diagram is depicted below
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
\tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=yellow!40]

\node[initial,state, accepting] (q0)          {$q_0$};
\node[state]         (q1) [above right of=q0, xshift=20pt] {$q_1$};
\node[state]         (q2) [below right of=q0, xshift=20pt] {$q_2$};
\node[state]         (q3) [below right of=q1, xshift=20pt] {$q_3$};

\path (q0) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$1$} (q0)
        edge [bend left=20, near end] node {$0$} (q1)
    (q1) edge [bend left=0] node {$0$} (q2)
        edge [bend left=20] node {$1$} (q3)
    (q2) edge [bend left=20] node {$0$} (q0)
        edge [bend right=20] node {$1$} (q3)
    (q3) edge [loop right] node {$0,1$} (q3)
;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3\}$, $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, and $F = \{q_0\}$, and $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$
is specified by the look-up table
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        & $0$ & $1$ \\
    \hline
  $q_0$ & $q_1$ & $q_0$ \\
  $q_1$ & $q_2$ & $q_3$ \\
  $q_2$ & $q_0$ & $q_3$ \\
  $q_3$ & $q_3$ & $q_3$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  A friend tries to summarize the transition function with the formula
    \[
        \delta(q_i,x) = \begin{cases}
            q_0 &\text{ when $i=0$ and $x=1$} \\
            q_3 &\text{ when $0<i\leq 3$ and $x=1$}\\
            q_j &\text{ when $j = (i+1) \mod 3$ and $x=0$}
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Are they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a counterexample to disprove it.
    ({\it Note: the original released homework had some extra words at the end of the sentence - sorry!})

    \item Give a regular expression $R$ so that $L(R)$ is the language 
    recognized by this finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the 
    definition of the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite automata. 
    Include an explanation for why each string in $L(R)$ is accepted by the finite automaton {\it and}
    for why each string not in $L(R)$ is rejected by the finite automaton.

    \item  Keeping the same set of states $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3\}$, alphabet $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, 
    same start state $q_0$, and same transition 
    function $\delta$, choose a new set of accepting states $F_{new}$ so that the new 
    finite automaton that results accepts at least one string that the original one rejected {\bf and} rejects
    at least one string that the original one accepted, or explain why there is no such choice of $F_{new}$.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your choice of $F_{new}$
    and a precise and clear the two example strings using relevant definitions 
    to justify them, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.
