\textbf{Assigned questions}

\begin{enumerate} 

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%

\item \textbf{Regular or not?} (15 points):\\
Fix $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ and $\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}$.
For each of the languages listed below, 
prove that it is either regular or nonregular. {\it Note:} You might find it useful to 
explore the definition of each set and 
consider alternate (simpler) ways of stating it.

For each language that is regular, a complete 
solution will include a 
precise definition of a DFA, NFA, or regular 
expression that recognizes or describes it, along 
with a brief justification
of your construction by explaining the role each 
state plays in the machine
or referring back to relevant definitions.

For each language that is nonregular, a complete
solution will use the pumping lemma to prove that it is nonregular, 
including appropriate
justification related to the specific language.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrectFirst $L_1 = \{0^n x 1^n \mid n \ge 1, x \in \Sigma^*\}$, a language over $\Sigma$.
    \item\gradeCorrect $L_2 = \{0^n 1 x 0 1^n \mid n 
    \ge 1, x \in \Sigma^* \}$, a language over 
    $\Sigma$.
    \item\gradeCorrect 
    Recall that for $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, we define
    \begin{align*}
    \REP(L) &:= \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{between every pair of successive $2$'s in $w$ is a string in $L$}\}\\
    &\phantom{:}=\{w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{for all } v \in \Sigma^* \text{ if } 2v2 \in \SUBSTRING(\{w\})  \text{, then } v \in L\} 
    \end{align*}
    $L_3 = \REP( \{ 0^n 1^n \mid n \geq 1 \} )$, 
    a language over $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%

\item \textbf{Properties of nonregular languages} (15 points): \\
Prove or disprove each of the following statements. In other words, decide whether 
each statement is true or false and justify your decision. 
Let $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ and let $\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrect For all languages $L, K$ over
    $\Sigma$, if $L$ is nonregular and $K$ is finite, then $L - K$ is nonregular.
    Recall: $L - K = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \in L \text{ and } w \notin K\}$.
    \item\gradeCorrect Every infinite language over $\Sigma$ 
    where each string in the language has an equal number of $0$'s and 
    $1$'s is nonregular.
    \item\gradeCorrect Recall that for language $K$ over $\Gamma$,
    \[
    \SUBSTRING(K) := \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{there exist } a,b \in \Gamma^* \text{ such that } awb \in K\}.
    \]
    For every nonregular language $K$ over $\Gamma$, $\SUBSTRING(K)$ is nonregular.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textbf{Pumping dilemma} (8 points): \\
Your friend claims that the Pumping Lemma is useless for proving that an infinite language 
$K \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is not regular. Their logic goes like this

\begin{enumerate}[label=(Step~\arabic*), leftmargin=2cm]
\item[(Step 1)] Suppose that $K$ is regular. It can be recognized by a 
DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.
\item[(Step 2)] For arbitrary DFA $M$, the pumping length $p$ is at least $|Q|$.
\item[(Step 3)] However, for every integer $n \ge |Q|$, there exists a machine 
$M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ such that $L(M') = L(M) = K$ and $|Q'| = n$.
\item[(Step 4)] Therefore, the Pumping Lemma cannot be used to pump any string 
of finite length since its pumping length might be arbitrarily large.
\end{enumerate}

Below, we will examine the steps above in detail. Justify your answer to each part.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst (Step 1): Is this statement true? In other words, just because we're assuming that $K$ is regular a regular language, does it mean we can assume there is a DFA that recognizes it?

    \item\gradeComplete (Step 2): 
    In general, it's true that the smallest the pumping length of a language
    recognized by a DFA with states $Q$ can be is $|Q|$. Prove this by finding a specific infinite language $K$ and a DFA recognizing 
    where $K$ cannot have pumping length smaller than $|Q|$.

    \item\gradeComplete (Step 3): This step is correct;
    prove the stated version of this statement: For every integer $n \ge |Q|$, there 
    exists a machine $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ such that $L(M') = L(M)$ and $|Q'| = n$.

    (\textit{Challenge; not graded}): 
    Define a \emph{cycle} to be a sequence of \emph{distinct} states $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m$ such that
	\[
	\delta(q_1, \sigma_1) = q_2, \hspace{1cm} \delta(q_2, \sigma_2) = q_3, \hspace{.5cm} \ldots, \hspace{.5cm}\delta(q_m, \sigma_m) = q_1, 
	\]
	where $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_m \in \Sigma$ are symbols in the alphabet. 
    An objection to the statement in (Step 3) is that the proof of the Pumping Lemma 
    depends on the length of the cycles in the DFA rather than the number of states. That is, 
    increasing the number of states in your DFA might not increase the pumping length because 
    the length of the smallest cycle stays the same. Nevertheless, a version of your friend's statement 
    is still true whenever you impose this additional cycle constraint:  for every integer $n \ge |Q|$, 
    there exists a machine $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ such that $L(M') = L(M)$ and the length 
    of the smallest cycle in the $M'$ is at least $n$. \\

	Your task is to show that even this more general statement is true for the simple language $\Sigma^*$ 
    recognized by the DFA below:
	\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
    \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=yellow!40]

    \node[initial,state, accepting] (q0) {$q_0$};

    \path (q0)  edge [loop right] node {$0,1$} (q0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
	For all $n \ge 1$, define a DFA for this language where the length of the smallest cycle is $n$.

    \item\gradeComplete (Step 4): Describe why this statement is true/false/misleading.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textbf{A PDA with multiple possibilities} (12 points): \\
Consider the PDA with input and stack alphabet $\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}$ 
whose ``unfinished" state diagram is given below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2.5cm, semithick]
  \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=yellow!40]

  \node[initial,state, accepting] (q0)      {$q_0$};
  \node[state]         (q1) [right of=q0,  xshift=0cm] {$q_1$};
  \node[state]         (q2) [right of=q1,  xshift=1cm] {$q_2$};
  \node[state]         (q3) [above of=q2] {$q_3$};
  \node[state, accepting]         (q4) [below of=q2] {$q_4$};

  \path (q0) edge [loop above] node[align=left] {$0, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$ \\ $1, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$}  (q0)
  		edge node {$2, \varepsilon; 2$} (q1)
	(q1) 	edge node {$\varepsilon, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (q2)
		edge node[below, sloped] {$\varepsilon, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (q4)
	(q2) edge [loop right] node {$E_1$} (q2)
		edge [right] node {$\varepsilon, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (q3)
	(q3) edge [loop right] node {$E_2$} (q3)
		edge node[sloped] {$E_3$} (q1)
	(q4) edge [loop right] node[align=left] {$0, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$ \\ $1, \varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (q4)
 ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrect Prove that (no matter how the labels $E_1, E_2, E_3$ are specified), 
    the language recognized by this 
    PDA is infinite. A complete solution will include a precise
    description of an infinite collection of strings each 
    of which is accepted by the PDA, with 
    a precise and
    clear description of the accepting computation of the PDA on 
    each of these strings.

    \item\gradeCorrect Determine how to set the labels $E_1, E_2, E_3$ so that the language of the PDA is 
    \[
    \REP(\{0^n1^m \mid n \ge 0, m \ge 0\})
    \]
    To be precise, each $E_i$ should be of the form ``$x,y; z$'' 
    where $x, y, z \in \Gamma_{\varepsilon}$ (recall $\Gamma_{\varepsilon} = \Gamma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$).
    In addition to specifying each $E_i$, a complete justification 
    will include a precise description of why this choice of $E_i$
    means that the PDA recognizes the language indicated.

    \item\gradeCorrect Determine how to set the labels $E_1, E_2, E_3$ so that the language of the PDA is 
    \[
    \REP(\{0^n1^m \mid n \ge 0, m \ge 0\})
    \]
    As in the previous part, each $E_i$ should be of the form ``$x,y; z$'' where $x, y, z \in \Gamma_{\varepsilon}$ (recall $\Gamma_{\varepsilon} = \Gamma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$).
    In addition to specifying each $E_i$, a complete justification 
    will include a precise description of why this choice of $E_i$
    means that the PDA recognizes the language indicated.
