{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ({\it Graded for correctness}\footnote{This means your solution will be
    evaluated not only on the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to 
    present your ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at 
    your conclusions, using  mathematically sound reasoning. Whether you use formal proof techniques or 
    write a more informal argument for why 
    something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your goal 
    should be to convince the reader that 
    your results and methods are sound.}) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Give an example of a decidable language $L_1$ whose complement is also decidable.
        A complete solution will include either (1) a precise definition of the example language $L_1$ and 
        an explanation of why it is decidable and why its complement is decidable, or 
        (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument for why there is no way to choose 
        an example language to satisfy this requirement. All justifications and arguments should
        connect to the relevant definitions and the specific concepts being discussed.
        \item Give an example of a decidable language $L_2$ and a Turing machine $M_2$ such that
        $L(M_2) = L_2$ but $M_2$ does not decide $L_2$.  A complete solution will include either (1) precise
        definitions of $L_2$ and $M_2$ and justifications for why $L(M_2) = L_2$ and why $M_2$
        does not decide $L_2$, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument for why there is no way to choose 
        such a language and machine. For any machines you discuss, you can choose whether to use high-level descriptions,
        implementation level descriptions, or formal definitions. All justifications and arguments should
        connect to the relevant definitions and the specific concepts being discussed.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item ({\it Graded for fair effort completeness}\footnote{This means 
    you will get full credit so long as your submission demonstrates honest 
    effort to answer the question. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. 
    To demonstrate your honest effort in answering the question, we ask that you 
    include your attempt to answer *each* part of the question. If you get stuck 
    with your attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by explaining where 
    you got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.})

    Recall that a set $X$ is said to be {\bf closed} under an operation $OP$ if, for any elements in $X$, applying 
    $OP$ to them gives an element in $X$.  For example, the set of integers is closed under multiplication
    because if we take any two integers, their product is also an integer.
    
    Suppose $M_1$  and $M_2$ are Turing machines.  Consider the following high-level  
    descriptions of machines that give general constructions based on  $M_1$  and $M_2$.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the  following construction of a nondeterministic  Turing  machine:
    \begin{quote}
    ``On  input $w$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] Nondeterministically  split $w$ into two pieces, i.e. choose  $x,y$  such that  $w =  xy$.
    \item[2.] Simulate running $M_1$ on  $x$.
    \item[3.] Simulate running $M_2$ on  $y$.
    \item[4.] If both simulations in steps 2 and 3 accept, accept."
    \end{itemize}
    \end{quote}
    
    Can  this construction  be  used  to prove that the class  of  Turing-recognizable languages is closed under 
    concatenation? Briefly  justify your  answer.
    
    \item Consider the  following construction of an enumerator: 
    \begin{quote}
    ``Without any input
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] Build an enumerator $E_1$ that is equivalent to  $M_1$.
    \item[2.] Build an enumerator $E_2$ that is equivalent to  $M_2$.
    \item[3.] Start $E_1$ running and start $E_2$ running.
    \item[4.] Initialize a list of all strings that have been printed by $E_1$. Declare the variable $n_1$ to be the length of  this  list 
    (initially $n_1 = 0$).
    \item[5.] Initialize a list of all strings that have been printed 
    by $E_2$ so far.
    Declare the variable $n_2$ to be the length of  this  list (initially $n_2 = 0$).
    \item[6.] Every time a new string $x$ is printed by $E_1$: 
    \item[7.] \qquad Add this string to the list of strings printed by $E_1$ so far.
    \item[8.] \qquad Increment $n_1$ so it stores the current length of the list.
    \item[9.] \qquad For $j =  1 \ldots n_2$, 
    \item[10.] \qquad \qquad Let $w_j$ be the $j$th string in the list of strings printed  by  $E_2$
    \item[11.] \qquad \qquad Print $xw_j$.
    \item[12.] Every time a new string $y$ is printed by $E_2$: 
    \item[13.] \qquad Add this string to the list of strings printed by $E_2$ so far.
    \item[14.] \qquad Increment $n_2$ so it stores the current length of the list.
    \item[15.] \qquad For $i =  1 \ldots n_1$, 
    \item[16.] \qquad \qquad Let $u_i$ be the $i$th string in the list of strings printed  by  $E_1$
    \item[17.] \qquad \qquad Print $u_i y$."
    \end{itemize}
    \end{quote}
    
    Can this construction  be  used  to prove that the class  of  Turing-recognizable languages is closed under 
    concatenation? Briefly justify your  answer.
    
    \item Consider the following construction of a Turing machine:
    \begin{quote}
    ``On input $w$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] Let  $n = |w|$.
    \item[2.] Create a two dimensional array of strings  $s_{m,j}$ where $0 \leq m \leq n$ and  $0 \leq j \leq  1$.
    \item[3.] For each  $0 \leq m  \leq n$, initialize $s_{m,0}$ to be the prefix of  $w$ of length $m$ and $s_{m,1}$ to be
    the suffix  of $w$ of length  $n-m$.  In other words, $w= s_{m,0} s_{m,1}$  and $|s_{m,0}| = m$, $|s_{m,1}| =  n-m$.
    \item[4.] For $i = 1, 2, \ldots$
    \item[5.] \qquad For $k = 0, \ldots, i$
    \item[6.] \qquad \qquad  Run $M_1$  on $s_{\min{(k,n)},0}$ for (at most) $i$ steps.
    \item[7.] \qquad \qquad  Run $M_2$  on $s_{\min{(k,n)},1}$ for (at most) $i$ steps.
    \item[8.] \qquad \qquad If  both simulations  in steps 6 and 7 accept,  accept."
    \end{itemize}
    \end{quote}
    
    Can  this construction  be  used  to prove that the class  of  Turing-recognizable languages is closed under 
    concatenation? Briefly  justify your  answer.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item ({\it Graded for fair effort completeness}) 
    Recall that 
    \[
        A_{TM} =  \{ \langle M,  w \rangle \mid \text{$M$ is a  Turing machine, 
    $w$ is a string, and $w \in L(M)$} \}
    \]
     and 
    \[
         HALT_{TM} = \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid \text{$M$ is a Turing machine,
    $w$ is a string, and $M$ halts on $w$}\}
    \]

    Consider the Turing machines below, with input alphabet $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, tape alphabet 
    $\{0, 1, \textvisiblespace\}$, and state diagrams (with the usual conventions):
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1in]{../../resources/machines/Lect22TM1.png}\qquad\hfill \qquad
    \includegraphics[width=2in]{../../resources/machines/Lect22TM2.png}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give an example string that is in both $A_{TM}$ and $HALT_{TM}$ and that is related to one of the 
    two Turing machines whose state diagrams are given above, or explain why there is no such string.
    \item  Give an example string that is in $A_{TM}$ and is not in $HALT_{TM}$ and that is related to one of the 
    two Turing machines whose state diagrams are given above, or explain why there is no such string.
    \item Give an example string that is not in $A_{TM}$ and is in $HALT_{TM}$ and that is related to one of the 
    two Turing machines whose state diagrams are given above, or explain why there is no such string.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item ({\it Graded for correctness}) Fix  $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$  for this question. 
    For each part below, you can choose sets from the  following list:  
    \[
    \emptyset, A_{TM}, \overline{A_{TM}}, HALT_{TM}, \overline{HALT_{TM}}, E_{TM}, \overline{E_{TM}}, 
    EQ_{TM}, \overline{EQ_{TM}}, \Sigma^*
    \]
    You may use each set from the list {\bf at most once} in the examples below.  In  particular, you can't choose
    $A =  B = C =  D = X = Y =  \Sigma^*$.

    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find sets $A, B$ for which  the computable function
    \begin{align*}
    F &= \text{``On input $x$} \\
    &\text{1. Output $\langle \includegraphics[width=0.5in]{../../resources/machines/Lect22TM1.png} , 00\rangle$."}
    \end{align*}
    
    witnesses the mapping reduction $A  \leq_m B$.
    Justify your  answer by  proving that, for all  strings  $x$, $x \in A $ iff  $F(x) \in B$.
    If no such sets exist, justify why not.

    &\text{\qquad 1. If $y$ has a positive and odd length, reject.}\\
    &\text{\qquad 2. Else, if $y$ has a positive and even length, accept.}\\
    &\text{\qquad 3. Otherwise, run $M$ on $w$ and, if the computation halts, accept $y$."}\\
    &\text{4. Output  $\langle M'_x , \includegraphics[width=1in]{../../resources/machines/Lect22TM2.png}\rangle$."}
    \end{align*}
    
    \vspace{-10pt}
    
    witnesses the mapping reduction $C  \leq_m D$.
    Justify your  answer by  proving that, for all  strings $x$, $x \in C $ iff  $G(x) \in D$.
    If no such sets exist, justify why not.
