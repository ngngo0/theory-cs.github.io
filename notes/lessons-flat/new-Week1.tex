\newpage Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Spring 2023!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

We will use vocabulary that should be familiar from your discrete 
math and introduction to proofs classes.  Some of the notation conventions may 
be a bit different: we will use the notation from this class' textbook\footnote{Page references are to

{\bf Pre class reading for next time}: Example 1.51, Definition 1.52

{\it Notice}: we are jumping to Section 1.3 Regular Expressions and then will come back 
to Section 1.1 Finite Automata on Friday.


\newpage
\subsection*{Week 1 Wednesday}



Our motivation in studying sets of strings is that they can be used to encode problems.
To calibrate how difficult a problem is to solve, we describe how complicated the set of strings that encodes it is. 
How do we define sets of strings?


\vfill

How would you describe the language that has no elements at all?

\vfill

How would you describe the language that has all strings over $\{0,1\}$ as its elements?

\vfill

\newpage


{\bf Definition 1.52}: A {\bf regular expression} over alphabet $\Sigma$
is a syntactic expression that can describe a language over $\Sigma$. The collection of all regular
expressions is defined recursively:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}    
    $a$ is a regular expression, for $a \in \Sigma$

    $\varepsilon$ is a regular expression

    $\emptyset$ is a regular expression
\end{quote}

\item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}
    $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions 

    $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions

    $(R_1^*)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$ is a regular expression 
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
 

The {\it semantics} (or meaning) of the syntactic regular expression is the {\bf language
described by the regular expression}. The function that assigns a language to a regular expression
over $\Sigma$ is defined recursively, using familiar set operations:


\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}    
        The language described by $a$, for $a \in \Sigma$, is $\{a\}$ and we write 
        $L(a) = \{a\}$
    
        The language described by $\varepsilon$ is $\{\varepsilon\}$ and we write 
        $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon\}$
    
        The language described by $\emptyset$ is $\{\}$ and we write
        $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
    \end{quote}
    
    \item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is the union of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \cup R_2)~) = L(R_1) \cup L(R_2) = \{ w \mid w \in L(R_1) \lor w \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is the concatenation of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \circ R_2)~) = L(R_1) \circ L(R_2) = \{ uv \mid u \in L(R_1) \land v \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$ is a regular expression, the language described by the regular 
        expression $(R_1^*)$ is the {\bf Kleene star} of the language described by $R_1$ and we write
        $$L(~(R_1^*)~) = (~L(R_1)~)^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L(R_1)\}$$
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}
  
For the following examples assume the alphabet is $\Sigma_1 =  \{0,1\}$:
    
The language described by the regular expression $0$ is $L(0) = \{ 0 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $1$ is $L(1)  = \{ 1 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\varepsilon$ is $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon  \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\emptyset$ is $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

The language described by the regular expression $((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)$ is $L(~((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $1^+$ is $L(~(1)^+~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $\Sigma_1^* 1$ is $L(~\Sigma_1^* 1~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*$ 
is $L(~(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*~) = $

\vfill

A regular expression that describes the language $\{00, 01, 10, 11\}$ is 

\vfill

A regular expression that describes the language $\{ 0^n1 \mid n~\text{is even} \}$ is

{\it Shorthand and conventions}
    
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Assuming $\Sigma$ is the alphabet, we use the following conventions}\\
    \hline
    $\Sigma$   & regular  expression describing language consisting of  all strings  of length  $1$ over $\Sigma$\\
    $*$ then $\circ$ then $\cup$   & precedence order, unless parentheses are used to change it\\
    $R_1R_2$ & shorthand  for  $R_1  \circ R_2$ (concatenation symbol is implicit) \\
    $R^+$ & shorthand for $R^* \circ R$ \\
    $R^k$ & shorthand for $R$ concatenated with itself $k$ times, where $k$ is a natural number\\

\end{center}

\newpage
{\bf Caution: many programming languages that support regular expressions build in functionality
that is more powerful than the ``pure'' definition of regular expressions given here. }

Regular expressions are everywhere (once you start looking for them).

Software tools and languages often have built-in support for regular expressions to describe
{\bf patterns} that we want to match (e.g. Excel/ Sheets, grep, Perl, python, Java, Ruby).

Under the hood, the first phase of {\bf compilers} is to transform the strings we write 
in code to tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, literals). Compilers use regular expressions
to describe the sets of strings that can be used for each token type.

Next time: we'll start to see how to build machines that decide whether strings match the pattern
described by a regular expression.

\vfill


{\it Extra examples for practice:}

Which regular expression(s) below describe a language that includes the string $a$ as an element?

$a^* b^*$ 

\vfill

$a(ba)^* b$

\vfill

$a^* \cup b^*$

\vfill

$(aaa)^*$

$(\varepsilon \cup a) b$

strings, languages, and regular expressions.


Recall: Review quizzes based on class material are assigned each day. 
These quizzes will help you track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples 
we work in class. Quizzes can be submitted on Gradescope as many times (with no penalty) as 
you like until the quiz deadline: the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty 
late submission open until Sunday).

as Definition 1.23 on page 44 and a useful example is Example 1.24.

{\bf Pre class reading for next time}: Figure 1.4, Definition 1.5

{\it Notice}: On Friday we are going back to the start of Chapter 1 and will be discussing finite 
automata and their computations.

\newpage
\subsection*{Week 1 Friday}



{\bf Review}: Determine whether each statement below about regular expressions
over the alphabet $\{a,b,c\}$ is true or false:
   
True or False: \qquad 
   $a  \in L(~(a \cup b )~\cup c)$

True or False: \qquad 
   $ab  \in L(~ (a \cup b)^*  ~)$
   
True or False: \qquad    
   $ba \in L( ~ a^* b^* ~)$
   
True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon  \in L(a \cup b \cup c)$
   
True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon  \in L(~ (a \cup b)^*  ~)$

True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon \in L( ~ a^* b^* ~)$


{\bf From the pre-class reading, pages 34-36}:
A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is specified by  $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.
This $5$-tuple is called the {\bf formal definition} of the DFA. The DFA can also 
be represented by its state diagram: with nodes for the state, labelled edges specifying the 
transition function, and decorations on nodes denoting the start and accept states.

\begin{quote}
Finite set of states $Q$ can be labelled by any collection of distinct names. Often
we use default state labels $q0, q1, \ldots$ 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}  
The alphabet $\Sigma$ determines the possible inputs to the automaton. 
Each input to the automaton is a string over  $\Sigma$, and the automaton ``processes'' the input
one symbol (or character) at a time.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The transition function $\delta$ gives the next state of the DFA based on the current state of 
the machine and on the next input symbol.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The start state $q_0$ is an element of $Q$.  Each computation of the machine starts at the  start  state.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The accept (final) states $F$ form a subset of the states of the DFA, $F \subseteq  Q$. 
These states are used to flag if the machine accepts or rejects an input string.
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
The computation of a machine on an input string is a sequence of states
in the machine,  starting with the start state, determined by transitions 
of the machine as it reads successive input symbols.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The DFA $M$ accepts the given input string exactly when the computation of $M$ on the input string
ends in an accept state. $M$ rejects the given input string exactly when the computation of 
$M$ on the input string ends in a nonaccept state, that is, a state that is not in $F$.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote} 
The language of $M$, $L(M)$, is defined as the set of  all strings that are each accepted 
by the machine $M$. Each string that is rejected by $M$ is not in $L(M)$.
The language of $M$ is also called the language recognized by $M$.
\end{quote}   
   
What is {\bf finite} about all deterministic finite automata? (Select all that apply)
\begin{itemize}
   \item[$\square$] The size of the machine (number of states, number of arrows)
   \item[$\square$] The number of strings that are accepted by the machine
   \item[$\square$] The length of each computation of the machine
\end{itemize}
