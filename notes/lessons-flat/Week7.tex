{\it From Friday's review quiz: }
Which of the following sentences make sense? Which of those are true?

A language is a decider if it always halts.

\vfill

The union of two deciders is a decider.

\vfill

A language is decidable if and only if it is recognizable.

\vfill

There is a Turing machine that isn't decidable.

\vfill

There is a recognizable language that isn't decided by any Turing machine.

\vfill

\newpage


{\bf Claim}: If two languages  (over a fixed alphabet  $\Sigma$) are Turing-recognizable, then  their union  is  as well.

{\bf Proof using Turing machines}:

{\bf Proof using nondeterministic Turing machines}:

{\bf  Proof using enumerators}:

The first line of a {\bf high-level description} of a Turing machine specifies the input to the machine, which must be a string.
This string may be the encoding of some object or  list of  objects.  

{\bf Notation:} $\langle O \rangle$ is the string that encodes the object $O$.
$\langle O_1, \ldots, O_n \rangle$ is the string that encodes the list of objects $O_1, \ldots, O_n$.

{\bf Assumption}: There are Turing  machines that can be called as subroutines
to decode the string representations of common objects and  interact with these objects as intended
(data structures).
  
For example, since there are algorithms to answer each of the following questions,
by Church-Turing thesis, there is a Turing machine that accepts exactly those strings for which the 
answer to the question is ``yes''
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ have even length?

    \vfill

    \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ encode a string of ASCII characters?\footnote{An introduction to ASCII 
    is available on the w3 tutorial \href{https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp}{here}.}

    \vfill

    \item Does a DFA have a specific number of states?

    \vfill

    \item Do two NFAs have any state names in common?

    \vfill

    \item Do two CFGs have the same start variable?

    \vfill

  \end{itemize}

A {\bf computational problem} is decidable iff language encoding its positive problem instances
is decidable.

The computational problem ``Does a specific DFA accept a given string?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of DFAs $M$ and strings $w$ such that $w \in L(M)$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a DFA}, w \textrm{ is a string}, w \in L(M) \}
\end{align*}

The computational problem ``Is the language generated by a CFG empty?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of CFGs $G$  such that $L(G) = \emptyset$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \textrm{ is a CFG},  L(G) = \emptyset \}
\end{align*}



The computational problem ``Is the given Turing machine a decider?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of TMs $M$  such that $M$ halts on every input}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a TM and for each string } w, \textrm{$M$ halts on $w$} \}
\end{align*}


{\it Note: writing down the language encoding a computational problem is only the first step in 
determining if it's recognizable, decidable, or \ldots }

machine that recognizes the language encoding the computational problem, and that 
is a decider.

  {\bf Summary}:  We can use the decision procedures (Turing machines) of decidable problems
  as subroutines in other algorithms. For example, we have subroutines for deciding each of 
  $A_{DFA}$, $E_{DFA}$, $EQ_{DFA}$.  We can also use algorithms for known constructions
  as subroutines in other algorithms. For example, we have subroutines for: counting the number 
  of states in a state diagram, counting the number of characters in an alphabet, converting DFA
  to a DFA recognizing the complement of the original language or a DFA recognizing the 
  Kleene star of the original language, constructing a DFA or NFA from two DFA or NFA so that 
  we have a machine recognizing the language of the union (or intersection, concatenation)
  of the languages of the original machines; converting regular expressions to equivalent DFA; 
  converting DFA to equivalent regular expressions, etc.

{\bf  Theorem}: $A_{TM}$  is  Turing-recognizable.


{\bf  Strategy}:  To prove this theorem, we need  to  define  a Turing  machine  $R_{ATM}$ such that 
$L(R_{ATM}) = A_{TM}$.


Define $R_{ATM} =  $ ``

\vspace{150pt}


Proof of correctness: 


\vfill
\vfill

We will show that $A_{TM}$ is undecidable.   {\it First, let's explore what that means.}

\newpage

A {\bf Turing-recognizable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some Turing machine. We also 
say that such languages are recognizable.

A {\bf Turing-decidable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some decider. We also 
say that such languages are decidable.

An {\bf unrecognizable} language is a language that is not Turing-recognizable.

An {\bf undecidable} language is a language that is not Turing-decidable.


{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  undecidable language  is  also  unrecognizable.


{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  unrecognizable language  is  also  undecidable.


To prove that a computational problem is {\bf decidable}, we find/ build a Turing 
machine that recognizes the language encoding the computational problem, and that 
is a decider.


How do we prove a specific problem is {\bf not decidable}?

How would we even find such a computational problem?


{\it Counting arguments for the existence of an undecidable language:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of all Turing machines is countably infinite.
    \item Each Turing-recognizable language is associated with a Turing machine
    in a one-to-one relationship, so there can be no more Turing-recognizable
    languages than there are Turing machines. 
    \item Since there are infinitely many Turing-recognizable languages
    (think of the singleton sets), there are countably infinitely 
    many Turing-recognizable languages.
    \item Such the set of Turing-decidable languages is an infinite subset 
    of the set of Turing-recognizable languages, the set of 
    Turing-decidable languages is also countably infinite.
\end{itemize}

Since there are uncountably many languages (because $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)$
is uncountable), there are uncountably many unrecognizable languages
and there are uncountably many undecidable languages.


Thus, there's at least one undecidable language!

\vfill

{\bf What's a specific example of a language that is unrecognizable or undecidable?}

To prove that a language is undecidable, we need to prove that there is no Turing machine that decides it.

{\bf Key idea}: proof by contradiction relying on self-referential disagreement.
