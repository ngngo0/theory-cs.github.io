In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
DFA give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a DFA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of DFAs.

{\bf Review}: Formal definition of DFA: $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ 

\begin{center}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
\item Finite set of states $Q$
\item Alphabet $\Sigma$
\item Transition function $\delta$
\item Start state $q_0$
\item Accept (final) states $F$
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\end{center}
In the state diagram of $M$, how many outgoing arrows are there from each state?

$M = ( \{ q, r, s\}, \{a,b\}, \delta, q, \{s\} )$ 
where $\delta$ is  (rows labelled by states
and columns labelled by symbols):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
$\delta$ & $a$ & $b$ \\
\hline
$q$ & $r$ & $q$ \\
$r$ & $r$ & $s$ \\
$s$ & $s$ & $s$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The state diagram for $M$ is

Give two examples of strings that are accepted by $M$ and two examples of strings that are rejected by $M$:

\vfill

Add ``labels" for states in the state diagram, e.g. ``have not seen any of desired pattern yet'' or
``sink state''.
\newpage

We can use the analysis of the roles of the states in the state diagram to describe the language
recognized by the DFA. 


$L(M) = $

Please complete the review quiz questions on \href{http://gradescope.com}{Gradescope} about 
the languages recognized by DFAs.


Recall: Review quizzes based on class material are assigned each day. 
These quizzes will help you track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples 
we work in class. Quizzes can be submitted on Gradescope as many times (with no penalty) as 
you like until the quiz deadline: the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty 
late submission open until Sunday).

Suppose A is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$. By definition, this means A is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.

{\bf Proof idea}:


{\bf Proof}: 




\vfill
A useful (optional) bit of terminology: the {\bf iterated transition function} of a DFA
$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is defined recursively by
\[
\delta^* (~(q,w)~) 
=\begin{cases}
q  \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q, w = \varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q,a)~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = a \in \Sigma$ } \\
\delta(~(\delta^*(q,u), a) ~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = ua$ where $u \in  \Sigma^*$ and $a \in \Sigma$}
\end{cases}
\]

Using  this terminology, $M$ accepts a string $w$ over $\Sigma$ if and only if $\delta^*( ~(q_0,w)~) \in F$.

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M_1$ such that $L(M_1) = A_1$ and 
DFA $M_2$ such that $L(M_2) = A_2$, then there is another DFA, let's call it $M$, such that 
$L(M) = A_1 \cap A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}:


{\bf Formal construction}:

{\bf Application}:  When $A_1 = \{w \mid w~\text{has $ab$ as a substring} \}$ and 
$A_2 = \{ w \mid w~\text{is of even length} \}$.
