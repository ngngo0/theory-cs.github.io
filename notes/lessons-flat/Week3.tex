\section*{Monday: Automata constructions}



{\bf Warmup}: Design a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) and an NFA (nondeterministic
finite automaton) that each recognize each of the following languages over $\{a,b\}$
\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ and ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill

\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ or ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill



\textbf{Strategy}: To design DFA or NFA for a given language,  
identify patterns that can be built up as we process strings and create states
for intermediate stages. Or: decompose the language to a simpler one 
that we already know how to recognize with a DFA or NFA.


{\it Recall} (from Wednesday of last week, and in textbook Exercise 1.14): 
if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.


Let's practice defining automata constructions by coming up with other ways to get new automata from old.
\newpage

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Use nondeterminism to choose which of $N_1$, $N_2$ to run.

\vfill
\begin{comment}
    Draw schematic
\end{comment}

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that $q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $x \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \phantom{\delta((q,x))=\begin{cases}  \delta_1 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_1 \\ \delta_2 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_2 \\ \{q1,q2\} &\qquad\text{if } q = q_0, x = \varepsilon \\ \emptyset\text{if } q= q_0, x \neq \varepsilon \end{cases}}
        \]
\end{itemize}


\vfill
{\it Proof of correctness would prove that $L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$ by considering
an arbitrary string accepted by $N$, tracing an accepting computation of $N$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string is in at least one of $A_1$, $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary 
string in $A_1 \cup A_2$ and proving that it is accepted by $N$. Details left for extra practice.}

Could we do the same construction with DFA?

\vspace{50pt}

Happily, though, an analogous claim is true!

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M_1$ such that $L(M_1) = A_1$ and 
DFA $M_2$ such that $L(M_2) = A_2$, then there is another DFA, let's call it $M$, such that 
$L(M) = A_1 \cup A_2$. {\it Theorem 1.25 in Sipser, page 45}

\subsection*{Wednesday: Regular languages}



So far we have that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a DFA recognizing a language, there is a DFA recognizing its complement.
\item If there are NFA recognizing two languages, there is a NFA recognizing their union.
\item If there are DFA recognizing two languages, there is a DFA recognizing their union.
\item If there are DFA recognizing two languages, there is a DFA recognizing their intersection.
\end{itemize}

Our goals for today are (1) prove similar results about other set operations, (2) prove that 
NFA and DFA are equally expressive, and therefore (3) define an important class of languages.

\vfill

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \circ A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Allow computation to move between $N_1$ and $N_2$ ``spontaneously" when reach an accepting state of 
$N_1$, guessing that we've reached the point where the two parts of the string in the set-wise concatenation 
are glued together.


{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $q_0 = $
    \item $F = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \delta((q,a))=\begin{cases}  
                \delta_1 ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_1 \textrm{ and } q \notin F_1\\ 
                \delta_1 ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in F_1 \textrm{ and } a \in \Sigma\\ 
                \delta_1 ((q,a)) \cup \{q_2\} &\qquad\text{if } q\in F_1 \textrm{ and } a = \varepsilon\\ 
                \delta_2 ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_2
            \end{cases}
        \]
\end{itemize}

\vfill

{\it Proof of correctness would prove that $L(N) = A_1 \circ A_2$ by considering
an arbitrary string accepted by $N$, tracing an accepting computation of $N$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string can be written as the result of concatenating two strings, 
the first in $A_1$ and the second in $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary 
string in $A_1 \circ A_2$ and proving that it is accepted by $N$. Details left for extra practice.}

\newpage



Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N$ such that $L(N) = A$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N'$, such that 
$L(N') = A^*$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Add a fresh start state, which is an accept state. Add spontaneous 
moves from each (old) accept state to the old start state.

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_1, F)$ and assume $q_0 \notin Q$.
Construct $N' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0, F')$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q' = Q \cup \{q_0\}$
    \item $F' = F \cup \{q_0\}$
    \item $\delta': Q' \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q')$ is defined by, for $q \in Q'$ and $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \delta'((q,a))=\begin{cases}  
                \delta ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q \textrm{ and } q \notin F\\ 
                \delta ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in F \textrm{ and } a \in \Sigma\\ 
                \delta ((q,a)) \cup \{q_1\} &\qquad\text{if } q\in F \textrm{ and } a = \varepsilon\\ 
                \{q_1\} &\qquad\text{if } q = q_0 \textrm{ and } a = \varepsilon \\
                \emptyset &\qquad\text{if } q = q_0 \textrm { and } a \in \Sigma
            \end{cases}
        \]
\end{itemize}


{\it Proof of correctness would prove that $L(N') = A^*$ by considering
an arbitrary string accepted by $N'$, tracing an accepting computation of $N'$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string can be written as the result of concatenating some number of strings, 
each of which is in $A$; then, taking an arbitrary 
string in $A^*$ and proving that it is accepted by $N'$. Details left for extra practice.}


{\bf Application}: A state diagram for a NFA over $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ 
that recognizes $L (( a^*b)^* )$:

\vfill
\newpage
Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N$ such that $L(N) = A$ then 
there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$.

{\bf Proof idea}: States in $M$ are ``macro-states" -- collections of states from $N$ -- 
that represent the set of possible states a computation of $N$ might be in.


{\bf Formal construction}: Let $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.  Define 
\[
M = (~ \mathcal{P}(Q), \Sigma, \delta', q',  \{ X \subseteq Q \mid X \cap F \neq \emptyset \}~ )
\]
where $q' = \{ q \in Q \mid \text{$q = q_0$ or is accessible from $q_0$ by spontaneous moves in $N$} \}$
and 
\[
    \delta' (~(X, x)~) = \{ q \in Q \mid q \in \delta( ~(r,x)~) ~\text{for some $r \in X$ or is accessible 
from such an $r$ by spontaneous moves in $N$} \}
\]


Consider the state diagram of an NFA over $\{a,b\}$. Use the ``macro-state'' construction 
to find an equivalent DFA.

Note: We can often prune the DFAs that result from the ``macro-state'' constructions to get an 
equivalent DFA with fewer states (e.g.\ only the ``macro-states" reachable from the start state).

\newpage


{\bf The class of regular languages}

Fix an alphabet $\Sigma$. For each language $L$ over $\Sigma$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
    {\bf There is a DFA over $\Sigma$ that recognizes $L$}&$\exists M ~(M \textrm{ is a DFA and } L(M) = A)$\\
    {\it if and only if}&\\
    {\bf There is a NFA over $\Sigma$ that recognizes $L$}&$\exists N ~(N \textrm{ is a NFA and } L(N) = A)$\\
    {\it if and only if}&\\
    {\bf There is a regular expression over $\Sigma$ that describes $L$} &$\exists R ~(R \textrm{ is a regular expression and } L(R) = A)$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

A language is called {\bf regular} when any (hence all) of the above three conditions are met.

We already proved that DFAs and NFAs are equally expressive. It remains to prove that regular expressions 
are too.

Part 1: Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
If there is a regular expression $R$ such that $L(R) = A$, then there is a NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A$.

{\bf Structural induction}: Regular expression is built from basis regular expressions using inductive steps
(union, concatenation, Kleene star symbols). Use constructions to mirror these in NFAs.


{\bf Application}: A state diagram for a NFA over $\{a,b\}$ that recognizes $L(a^* (ab)^*)$:

\vfill

Part 2: Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
If there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$, then there is a regular expression, let's call it $R$, such that 
$L(R) = A$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Trace all possible paths from start state to accept state.  Express labels of these paths
as regular expressions, and union them all.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add new start state with $\varepsilon$ arrow to old start state.
\item Add new accept state with $\varepsilon$ arrow from old accept states.  Make old accept states
non-accept.
\item Remove one (of the old) states at a time: modify regular expressions on arrows that went through removed
state to restore language recognized by machine.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Application}: Find a regular expression describing the language recognized by the DFA with 
state diagram

\subsection*{Friday: Nonregular languages}



{\bf Definition and Theorem}: For an alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ over $\Sigma$ is called {\bf regular}
exactly when $L$ is recognized by some DFA, which happens exactly when $L$ is recognized by some NFA, 
and happens exactly when $L$ is described by some regular expression

{\bf We saw that}: The class of regular languages is closed under complementation, union, 
intersection, set-wise concatenation, and Kleene star.

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some language recognized by an NFA but not by any DFA.

\vfill

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some finite language not described by any regular expression over $\Sigma$.

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: If a language is recognized by an NFA 
then the complement of this language is not recognized by any DFA.

is a number $p$ (a {\it pumping length}) where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, 
then $s$ may be divided into three pieces, $s = xyz$ such that
