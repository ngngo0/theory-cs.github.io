In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
{\bf Finite automata} give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a FA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of these finite automata.
