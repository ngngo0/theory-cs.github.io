\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain the limits of the class of regular languages
        \item Identify some nonregular sets
    \end{itemize}
\item Use the pumping lemma to prove that a given language is not regular.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justify why the Pumping Lemma is true
        \item Apply the Pumping Lemma in proofs of nonregularity    
    \end{itemize}
\item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of PDA and 
use clear English to describe computations of PDA informally.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define push-down automata informally and formally
    \item Trace the computation of a push-down automaton
    \item Determine the language recognized by a given PDA
    \item Design push-down automata to recognize specific languages
    \item Determine whether a language is recognizable by a (D or N) FA and/or a PDA
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
