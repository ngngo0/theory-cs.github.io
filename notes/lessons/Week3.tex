\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain nondeterminism and describe tools for simulating it with deterministic computation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find equivalent DFA for a given NFA

    \item Convert between regular expressions and automata
 
\end{itemize}

\item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of DFA, NFA and 
use clear English to describe computations of DFA, NFA informally.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Determine the language recognized by a given NFA

   \item Design general constructions for NFA

   \item Choose between multiple models to prove that a language is regular
\end{itemize}
    
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the limits of the class of regular languages

\end{itemize}

\item Use the pumping lemma to prove that a given language is not regular.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Justify why the Pumping Lemma is true

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

   \item Review quizzes based on class material each day. 
   \item Homework assignment 2 due next Thursday.
