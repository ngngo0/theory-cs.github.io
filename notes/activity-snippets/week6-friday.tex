To define a Turing machine, we could give a 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Formal definition}: the $7$-tuple of parameters including set of states, 
input alphabet, tape alphabet, transition function, start state, accept state, and reject state; or,
\item {\bf Implementation-level definition}: English prose that describes the Turing machine head 
movements relative to contents of tape, and conditions for accepting / rejecting based on those contents.
\item {\bf High-level description}: description of algorithm (precise sequence of instructions), 
without implementation details of machine. As part of this description, can ``call" and run 
another TM as a subroutine.
\end{itemize}


{\bf Theorem 3.21} A language is Turing-recognizable iff some enumerator enumerates it.

{\bf Proof}:

Assume $L$ is enumerated by some enumerator, $E$, so $L = L(E)$.
We'll use $E$ in a subroutine
within a high-level description of a new Turing machine that we will build to recognize $L$.

{\bf Goal}: build Turing machine $M_E$ with $L(M_E) = L(E)$.

Define $M_E$ as follows: $M_E = $ ``On input $w$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run $E$. For each string $x$ printed by $E$.
\item \qquad Check if $x = w$. If so, accept (and halt); otherwise, continue."
\end{enumerate}

Assume $L$ is Turing-recognizable and there 
is a Turing  machine  $M$ with  $L = L(M)$. We'll use $M$ in a subroutine
within a high-level description of an enumerator that we will build to enumerate $L$.

{\bf Goal}: build enumerator $E_M$ with $L(E_M) = L(M)$.

{\bf Idea}: check each string in turn to see if it is in $L$.

{\it How?} Run computation of $M$ on each string.  {\it But}: need to be careful 
about computations that don't halt.

{\it Recall} String order for $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$: $s_1 = \varepsilon$, $s_2 = 0$, $s_3 = 1$, $s_4 = 00$, $s_5 = 01$, $s_6  = 10$, 
$s_7  =  11$, $s_8 = 000$, \ldots

Define $E_M$ as follows: $E_{M} = $ `` {\it ignore any input.} Repeat the following for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Run the computations of $M$ on $s_1$, $s_2$, \ldots, $s_i$ for (at most) $i$ steps each
  \item For each of these $i$ computations that accept during the (at most) $i$ steps, print
  out the accepted string."
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Nondeterministic Turing machine}

At any point in the computation, the nondeterministic machine may proceed according to 
several possibilities: $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{acc}, q_{rej})$ where 
\[
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\})  
\]
The computation of a nondeterministic Turing machine is a tree with branching
when the next step of the computation has multiple possibilities. A nondeterministic
Turing machine accepts a string exactly when some branch of the computation tree 
enters the accept state.

Given a nondeterministic machine, we can use a $3$-tape Turing machine to 
simulate it by doing a breadth-first search of computation tree: one tape 
is ``read-only'' input tape, one tape simulates the tape of the nondeterministic
computation, and one tape tracks nondeterministic branching. {\tiny Sipser page 178} 

\vfill
Two models of computation are called {\bf equally expressive} when 
every language recognizable with the first model is recognizable with the second, and vice versa.

{\bf  Church-Turing Thesis} (Sipser p. 183): The informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely  and correctly by the 
formal definition of a  Turing machine. In other words: all reasonably expressive models of 
computation are equally expressive with the standard Turing machine.

{\bf Claim}: If two languages  (over a fixed alphabet  $\Sigma$) are Turing-recognizable, then  their union  is  as well.
