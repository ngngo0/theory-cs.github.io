Recall: For  $M$ a deterministic decider, its {\bf running time} is the function  $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
given  by
\[
f(n) =  \text{max number of  steps $M$ takes before halting, over all inputs  of length $n$}
\]
For each function $t(n)$, the {\bf time complexity class}  $TIME(t(n))$, is defined  by
\[
TIME( t(n)) = \{ L \mid \text{$L$ is decidable by  a Turing machine with running time in  $O(t(n))$} \}
\]
$P$ is the class of languages that  are decidable in polynomial time on 
a deterministic 1-tape  Turing  machine
\[
P  =  \bigcup_k TIME(n^k)
\]

Definition (Sipser  7.9): For $N$ a nodeterministic decider.  
The {\bf running time} of $N$ is the function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ given  by
\[
f(n) =  \text{max number of  steps $N$ takes on  any branch before halting, over all inputs  of length $n$}
\]

Definition (Sipser 7.21): For each function $t(n)$, the {\bf nondeterministic time complexity class}  
$NTIME(t(n))$, is defined  by
\[
NTIME( t(n)) = \{ L \mid \text{$L$ is decidable by a nondeterministic Turing machine with running time in $O(t(n))$} \}
\]
\[
NP = \bigcup_k NTIME(n^k)
\]

{\bf Every problem in NP is decidable with an exponential-time algorithm}

Nondeterministic approach: guess a possible solution, verify that it works.

Brute-force (worst-case exponential time) approach: iterate over all possible solutions, for each 
one, check if it works.


\newpage

{\bf Examples in $P$ }

{\it Can't use nondeterminism; Can use multiple tapes; Often need to be “more clever” than naïve / brute force approach}
\[
    PATH = \{\langle G,s,t\rangle \mid \textrm{$G$ is digraph with $n$ nodes there is path from s to t}\}
\]
Use breadth first search to show in $P$
\[
    RELPRIME = \{ \langle x,y\rangle \mid \textrm{$x$ and $y$ are relatively prime integers}\}
\]
Use Euclidean Algorithm to show in $P$
\[
    L(G) = \{w \mid \textrm{$w$ is generated by $G$}\} 
\]
(where $G$ is a context-free grammar). Use dynamic programming to show in $P$.

Million-dollar question: Is $P = NP$?


One approach to trying to answer it is to look for {\it hardest} problems in $NP$ and 
then (1) if we can show that there are efficient algorithms for them, then we can get 
efficient algorithms for all problems in $NP$ so $P = NP$, or (2) these problems might 
be good candidates for showing that there are problems in $NP$ for which there 
are no efficient algorithms.


Definition (Sipser 7.29) Language  $A$ is {\bf polynomial-time mapping reducible} to language $B$, written $A \leq_P B$,
means there is a polynomial-time computable function $f: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$  such that for every $x \in \Sigma^*$
\[
x \in A \qquad \text{iff} \qquad f(x) \in B.
\]
The  function $f$ is  called the  polynomial time reduction of $A$ to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.31):  If $A \leq_P B$ and $B  \in P$ then $A \in P$.

Proof:

Definition (Sipser 7.34; based in Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin's work in the 1970s): 
A language $B$ is {\bf  NP-complete} means (1) $B$ is in NP {\bf and}  (2) every language
$A$ in $NP$ is polynomial time reducible to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.35):  If $B$ is NP-complete and $B \in P$ then $P = NP$.

{\bf 3SAT}: A literal is a Boolean variable (e.g.  $x$) or a negated Boolean variable (e.g.  $\bar{x}$).  
A Boolean formula is a {\bf  3cnf-formula} if it is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (a conjunction  
of  disjunctive clauses of literals) and each clause  has  three literals.
\[
3SAT  = \{  \langle  \phi \rangle \mid \text{$\phi$ is  a  satisfiable 3cnf-formula} \}
\]


Example strings  in $3SAT$


Example  strings not  in $3SAT$




{\bf Cook-Levin Theorem}: $3SAT$ is $NP$-complete.


{\it Are there other $NP$-complete problems?} To prove that $X$ is $NP$-complete
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it From scratch}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that all $NP$ problems are polynomial-time
reducible to $X$.
\item {\it Using reduction}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that a known-to-be $NP$-complete problem 
is polynomial-time reducible to $X$.
\end{itemize}




{\bf CLIQUE}: A {\bf $k$-clique} in an undirected graph is a maximally connected subgraph with $k$  nodes.
\[
CLIQUE  = \{  \langle G, k \rangle \mid \text{$G$ is an  undirected graph with  a $k$-clique} \}
\]

Example  strings not  in $CLIQUE$


Theorem (Sipser 7.32):
\[
3SAT  \leq_P CLIQUE
\]

Given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form with $k$ clauses and three literals per clause, we will 
map it to a graph so that the graph has a clique if the original formula is satisfiable and the 
graph does not have a clique if the original formula is not satisfiable.

The graph has $3k$ vertices (one for each literal in each clause) and an edge between all vertices except
\begin{itemize}
    \item vertices for two literals in the same clause
    \item vertices for literals that are negations of one another
\end{itemize}

Example: $(x \vee \bar{y} \vee {\bar z}) \wedge (\bar{x}  \vee y  \vee  z) \wedge (x \vee y  \vee z)$
