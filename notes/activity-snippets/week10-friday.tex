{\bf Given a language, prove it is regular}

{\it Strategy 1}: construct DFA recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it Strategy 2}: construct NFA recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it Strategy 3}: construct regular expression recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it ``Prove it works'' means \ldots}

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf Example}: $L  = \{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid \textrm{$w$ has odd number of $1$s or starts with $0$}\}$

Using regular expressions

\newpage

{\bf Example}: Select all and only the options that result in a true statement: ``To show 
a language $A$ is not regular, we can\ldots'' 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Show $A$ is finite
    \item[b.] Show there is a CFG generating $A$
    \item[c.] Show $A$ has no pumping length
    \item[d.] Show $A$ is undecidable
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

{\bf Example}: What is the language generated by the CFG with rules
\begin{align*}
    S &\to aSb \mid bY \mid Ya \\
    Y &\to bY \mid Ya \mid \varepsilon 
\end{align*}

\newpage

{\bf Example}: Prove that the language 
$T = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid \textrm{$M$ is a Turing machine and $L(M)$ is infinite}\}$ 
is undecidable.

\newpage

{\bf Example}: Prove that the class of decidable languages is closed under concatenation.
