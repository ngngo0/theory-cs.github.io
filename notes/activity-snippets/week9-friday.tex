Recall:  $A$ is  {\bf  mapping  reducible to} $B$, written $A \leq_m B$,  means there is a computable function 
$f : \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ such that {\it for all} strings  $x$ in $\Sigma^*$, 
\[
x  \in  A \qquad \qquad \text{if and  only  if} \qquad \qquad f(x) \in B.
\]
\[
EQ_{TM} = \{ \langle M, M' \rangle \mid \text{$M$ and $M'$ are both Turing machines and $L(M) =L(M')$} \}
\]

Example  string in  $EQ_{TM}$ is \underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.5in}}} .
Example  string not  in  $EQ_{TM}$ is \underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.5in}}} .

$EQ_{TM}$ is ~~decidable /  undecidable~~ and ~~recognizable /  unrecognizable~~.

$\overline{EQ_{TM}}$ is ~~decidable /  undecidable~~ and ~~recognizable /  unrecognizable~~.

To  prove, show that  $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.6in}}}  \leq_m EQ_{TM}$
and that $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.6in}}}  \leq_m \overline{EQ_{TM}}$.

Verifying correctness:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Input string &  Output string \\
\hline
$\langle M, w \rangle$ where  $M$ halts on $w$ & \phantom{\hspace{4in}} \\
& \\
$\langle M, w \rangle$ where $M$ loops on $w$ & \\
&\\
$x$ not encoding any pair of  TM and string   &  \\

In practice, computers (and Turing machines) don't have infinite tape, 
and we can't afford to wait unboundedly long for an answer.
``Decidable" isn't good enough - we want ``Efficiently decidable".

For a given algorithm working on a given input, how long do we need to wait for an answer? 
How does the running time depend on the input in the worst-case? average-case? 
We expect to have to spend more time on computations with larger inputs.


A language is {\bf recognizable} if \underline{\phantom{\hspace{4.5in}}}

A language is {\bf decidable} if \underline{\phantom{\hspace{4.7in}}}

A language is {\bf efficiently  decidable} if \underline{\phantom{\hspace{4in}}}

A function is {\bf computable} if \underline{\phantom{\hspace{4.7in}}}

A function is {\bf efficiently computable} if \underline{\phantom{\hspace{4in}}}\\

Definition  (Sipser 7.1): For  $M$ a deterministic decider, its {\bf running time} is the function  $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
given  by
\[
f(n) =  \text{max number of  steps $M$ takes before halting, over all inputs  of length $n$}
\]

Definition (Sipser 7.7): For each function $t(n)$, the {\bf time complexity class}  $TIME(t(n))$, is defined  by
\[
TIME( t(n)) = \{ L \mid \text{$L$ is decidable by  a Turing machine with running time in  $O(t(n))$} \}
\]

An example of an element of  $TIME(  1  )$ is 

An example of an element of  $TIME(  n  )$ is 


Note: $TIME( 1) \subseteq TIME (n)  \subseteq TIME(n^2)$

\vfill

Definition (Sipser 7.12) : $P$ is the class of languages that  are decidable in polynomial time on 
a deterministic 1-tape  Turing  machine
\[
P  =  \bigcup_k TIME(n^k)
\]

{\it Compare to exponential time: brute-force search.}


Theorem (Sipser 7.8): Let $t(n)$ be a  function with  $t(n)  \geq n$.  Then every $t(n)$ time deterministic 
multitape Turing machine has an equivalent $O(t^2(n))$ time deterministic 1-tape Turing machine.
