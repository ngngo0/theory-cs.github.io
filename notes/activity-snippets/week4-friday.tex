{\it Big picture}: PDAs were motivated by wanting to add some memory of unbounded size to NFA. How 
do we accomplish a similar enhancement of regular expressions to get a syntactic model that is 
more expressive?

DFA, NFA, PDA: Machines process one input string at a time; the computation of a machine on its input string 
reads the input from left to right.

Regular expressions: Syntactic descriptions of all strings that match a particular pattern; the language 
described by a regular expression is built up recursively according to the expression's syntax

{\bf Context-free grammars}: Rules to produce one string at a time, adding characters from the middle, beginning, 
or end of the final string as the derivation proceeds.

  {\bf Context-free grammar} (CFG) & $G$ & $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ \\
  {\bf Variables}& $V$ & Finite  set of symbols that represent phases in production pattern\\
  {\bf Terminals} & $\Sigma$ & Alphabet of symbols of strings generated  by CFG \\

  {\bf Derivation} & & Sequence  of substitutions in a  CFG \\

  {\bf Language} generated by the CFG $G$ & $L(G)$ &$\{  w \in \Sigma^* \mid \text{there is  derivation in $G$ that ends
  in $w$} \} = \{  w \in \Sigma^* \mid S \implies^* w \}$\\

{\it Extra practice}: Is there a CFG $G$ with $L(G) = \emptyset$?
