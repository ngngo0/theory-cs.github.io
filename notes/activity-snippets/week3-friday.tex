{\bf Theorem}: For an alphabet $\Sigma$, For each language $L$ over $\Sigma$, 
\begin{center}
$L$ is recognized by some DFA \\
iff\\
$L$ is recognized by some NFA\\
iff\\
$L$ is described by some regular expression
\end{center}
If (any, hence all) these conditions apply, $L$ is called {\bf regular}.



{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some language recognized by an NFA but not by any DFA.

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some finite language not described by any regular expression over $\Sigma$.

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: If a language is recognized by an NFA 
then the complement of this language is not recognized by any DFA.

{\bf Pumping Lemma} (Sipser Theorem 1.70): If $A$ is a regular language, then there
is a number $p$ (a {\it pumping length}) where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, 
then $s$ may be divided into three pieces, $s = xyz$ such that
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item $|y| > 0$
\item for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^i z \in A$
\item $|xy| \leq p$.
\end{itemize}


{\bf True or False}: A pumping length for $A = \{ 0,1 \}^*$ is $p = 5$.

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf True or False}: A pumping length for $A = \{1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001 \}$ is $p = 4$.

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf True or False}: A pumping length for $A = \{0^j 1 \mid  j \geq 0 \}$ is $p = 3$.


\vspace{100pt}

{\bf True or False}: For any language $A$, if $p$  is a  pumping length for $A$ and $p' > p$,  then 
$p'$ is also a pumping length for $A$.
