Suppose A is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$. By definition, this means A is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.

{\bf Proof idea}:


{\bf Proof}: 




\vfill
A useful (optional) bit of terminology: the {\bf iterated transition function} of a DFA
$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is defined recursively by
\[
\delta^* (~(q,w)~) 
=\begin{cases}
q  \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q, w = \varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q,a)~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = a \in \Sigma$ } \\
\delta(~(\delta^*(q,u), a) ~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = ua$ where $u \in  \Sigma^*$ and $a \in \Sigma$}
\end{cases}
\]

Using  this terminology, $M$ accepts a string $w$ over $\Sigma$ if and only if $\delta^*( ~(q_0,w)~) \in F$.

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M_1$ such that $L(M_1) = A_1$ and 
DFA $M_2$ such that $L(M_2) = A_2$, then there is another DFA, let's call it $M$, such that 
$L(M) = A_1 \cap A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}:

{\bf Application}:  When $A_1 = \{w \mid w~\text{has $ab$ as a substring} \}$ and 
$A_2 = \{ w \mid w~\text{is of even length} \}$.
