Recap so far: In DFA, the only memory available is in the states. Automata can only
``remember'' finitely far in the past and finitely much information, because
they can have only finitely many states. If a computation path of a DFA visits 
the same state more than once, the machine can't tell the difference between 
the first time and future times it visits this state. Thus, if 
a DFA accepts one long string, then it must accept (infinitely) many 
similar strings.

{\bf Definition}  A positive integer $p$ is a {\bf pumping length} of a language $L$ over $\Sigma$ means
that, for each string $s  \in  \Sigma^*$, if  $|s| \geq p$ and $s \in L$, then there are strings $x,y,z$
such that 
\[
s = xyz
\]
and  
\[
|y| > 0,  \qquad \qquad 
\text{ for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^i z \in L$}, \qquad \text{and}
\qquad  \qquad
|xy| \leq p.
\]

{\bf Negation}: A positive integer  $p$  is {\bf not a pumping length} of a language  $L$ over  $\Sigma$  iff
\[
\exists s \left(~  |s| \geq  p \wedge s \in L \wedge \forall x \forall y \forall z  \left( ~\left( s = xyz \wedge 
|y| > 0 \wedge |xy| \leq p~ \right) \to \exists i  (  i \geq 0  \wedge xy^iz  \notin L ) \right) ~\right) 
\]
{\it Informally: }


Restating {\bf Pumping Lemma}: If $L$ is a regular language, then it  has
a pumping length.


{\bf Contrapositive}: If $L$ has no pumping length, then  it is nonregular.

\vfill

{\Large The Pumping Lemma {\it cannot} be used to prove that a language {\it is} regular.} 

{\Large The Pumping Lemma {\bf can} be used to prove that a language {\it is not} regular.}

{\it Extra practice}: Exercise 1.49 in the book.


\vfill

{\bf Proof strategy}: To prove that a language $L$ is {\bf not} regular, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider an arbitrary positive integer $p$
    \item Prove that $p$ is not a pumping length for $L$
    \item Conclude that $L$ does not have {\it any} pumping length, and therefore it is not regular.

Fix $p$ an arbitrary positive integer. List strings that are in $L$ and have length  greater than or equal  to $p$:

Regular sets are not the end of the story
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many nice / simple / important sets are not regular
    \item Limitation of the finite-state automaton model: Can't ``count", Can only remember finitely far into the past,
    Can't backtrack, Must make decisions in ``real-time"
    \item We know actual computers are more powerful than this model...
\end{itemize}

The {\bf next} model of computation. Idea: allow some memory of unbounded size. How? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item To generalize regular expressions: {\bf context-free grammars}\\
    \item To generalize NFA: {\bf Pushdown automata}, which is like an NFA with access to a stack: 
    Number of states is fixed, number of entries in stack is unbounded. At each step
    (1) Transition to new state based on current state, letter read, and top letter of stack, then
    (2) (Possibly) push or pop a letter to (or from) top of stack. Accept a string iff
    there is some sequence of states and some sequence of stack contents 
    which helps the PDA processes the entire input string and ends in an accepting state.
\end{itemize}

Is there a PDA that recognizes the nonregular language $\{0^n1^n \mid n \geq 0 \}$?

The PDA with state diagram above can be informally described as:
\begin{quote}
    Read symbols from the input. As each 0 is read, push it onto the stack. 
    As soon as 1s are seen, pop a 0 off the stack for each 1 read. 
    If the stack becomes empty and we are at the end of the input string, accept the input. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there are 1s left to read, 
    or if 1s are finished while the stack still contains 0s, or if any 0s
    appear in the string following 1s, 
    reject the input.
\end{quote}
    

Trace the computation of this PDA on the input string $01$.

A PDA recognizing the set $\{ \hspace{1.5 in} \}$ can be informally described as:

    Read symbols from the input. As each 0 is read, push it onto the stack. 
    As soon as 1s are seen, pop a 0 off the stack for each 1 read. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there is exactly one 1 left to read, read that 1 and accept the input. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there are either zero or more than one 1s left to read, 
    or if the 1s are finished while the stack still contains 0s, or if any 0s appear in the input following 1s, 
    reject the input.

\[
    \delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon  \times  \Gamma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}( Q \times \Gamma_\varepsilon)

is the transition function,  $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state, $F \subseteq  Q$ is the set of accept states.

{\it Big picture}: PDAs were motivated by wanting to add some memory of unbounded size to NFA. How 
do we accomplish a similar enhancement of regular expressions to get a syntactic model that is 
more expressive?

DFA, NFA, PDA: Machines process one input string at a time; the computation of a machine on its input string 
reads the input from left to right.

Regular expressions: Syntactic descriptions of all strings that match a particular pattern; the language 
described by a regular expression is built up recursively according to the expression's syntax

{\bf Context-free grammars}: Rules to produce one string at a time, adding characters from the middle, beginning, 
or end of the final string as the derivation proceeds.

The state diagram of an NFA over $\{a,b\}$ is below.  The formal definition of this NFA is:

The language recognized by this NFA is: 



Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Use nondeterminism to choose which of $N_1$, $N_2$ to run.


{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$

an arbitrary string accepted by $N$, tracing an accepting computation of $N$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string is in at least one of $A_1$, $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary

$L(N) = A_1 \circ A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Allow computation to move between $N_1$ and $N_2$ ``spontaneously" when reach an accepting state of 
$N_1$, guessing that we've reached the point where the two parts of the string in the set-wise concatenation 
are glued together.

Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$, then there is a regular expression, let's call it $R$, such that 
$L(R) = A$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Trace all possible paths from start state to accept state.  Express labels of these paths
as regular expressions, and union them all.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add new start state with $\varepsilon$ arrow to old start state.
\item Add new accept state with $\varepsilon$ arrow from old accept states.  Make old accept states
non-accept.
\item Remove one (of the old) states at a time: modify regular expressions on arrows that went through removed
state to restore language recognized by machine.

q  \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q, w = \varepsilon$} \\

{\bf Definition 1.52}: A {\bf regular expression} over alphabet $\Sigma$

\item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}    
    $a$ is a regular expression, for $a \in \Sigma$

    $\varepsilon$ is a regular expression

    $\emptyset$ is a regular expression

The {\it semantics} (or meaning) of the syntactic regular expression is the {\bf language

over $\Sigma$ is defined recursively, using familiar set operations:

        $$L(~(R_1 \cup R_2)~) = L(R_1) \cup L(R_2) = \{ w \mid w \in L(R_1) \lor w \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is the concatenation of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \circ R_2)~) = L(R_1) \circ L(R_2) = \{ uv \mid u \in L(R_1) \land v \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$ is a regular expression, the language described by the regular 
        expression $(R_1^*)$ is the {\bf Kleene star} of the language described by $R_1$ and we write
        $$L(~(R_1^*)~) = (~L(R_1)~)^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L(R_1)\}$$

For the following examples assume the alphabet is $\Sigma_1 =  \{0,1\}$:
    
The language described by the regular expression $0$ is $L(0) = \{ 0 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $1$ is $L(1)  = \{ 1 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\varepsilon$ is $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon  \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\emptyset$ is $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

The language described by the regular expression $((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)$ is $L(~((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)~) = $

{\bf Caution: many programming languages that support regular expressions build in functionality
that is more powerful than the ``pure'' definition of regular expressions given here. }

Regular expressions are everywhere (once you start looking for them).

Software tools and languages often have built-in support for regular expressions to describe
{\bf patterns} that we want to match (e.g. Excel/ Sheets, grep, Perl, python, Java, Ruby).

Under the hood, the first phase of {\bf compilers} is to transform the strings we write 
in code to tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, literals). Compilers use regular expressions
to describe the sets of strings that can be used for each token type.

Next time: we'll start to see how to build machines that decide whether strings match the pattern
described by a regular expression.

{\bf From the pre-class reading, pages 34-36}:
A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is specified by  $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.
This $5$-tuple is called the {\bf formal definition} of the DFA. The DFA can also 
be represented by its state diagram: with nodes for the state, labelled edges specifying the 
transition function, and decorations on nodes denoting the start and accept states.

\begin{quote}
Finite set of states $Q$ can be labelled by any collection of distinct names. Often
we use default state labels $q0, q1, \ldots$ 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}  
The alphabet $\Sigma$ determines the possible inputs to the automaton. 
Each input to the automaton is a string over  $\Sigma$, and the automaton ``processes'' the input
one symbol (or character) at a time.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The transition function $\delta$ gives the next state of the DFA based on the current state of 
the machine and on the next input symbol.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The start state $q_0$ is an element of $Q$.  Each computation of the machine starts at the  start  state.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The accept (final) states $F$ form a subset of the states of the DFA, $F \subseteq  Q$. 
These states are used to flag if the machine accepts or rejects an input string.
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
The computation of a machine on an input string is a sequence of states
in the machine,  starting with the start state, determined by transitions 
of the machine as it reads successive input symbols.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The DFA $M$ accepts the given input string exactly when the computation of $M$ on the input string
ends in an accept state. $M$ rejects the given input string exactly when the computation of 
$M$ on the input string ends in a nonaccept state, that is, a state that is not in $F$.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote} 
The language of $M$, $L(M)$, is defined as the set of  all strings that are each accepted 
by the machine $M$. Each string that is rejected by $M$ is not in $L(M)$.
The language of $M$ is also called the language recognized by $M$.

{\bf Given a language, prove it is regular}

{\it Strategy 1}: construct DFA recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it Strategy 2}: construct NFA recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it Strategy 3}: construct regular expression recognizing the language and prove it works.

{\it ``Prove it works'' means \ldots}

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf Example}: $L  = \{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid \textrm{$w$ has odd number of $1$s or starts with $0$}\}$

Using regular expressions

\vfill


\newpage

{\bf Example}: Select all and only the options that result in a true statement: ``To show 
a language $A$ is not regular, we can\ldots'' 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Show $A$ is finite
    \item[b.] Show there is a CFG generating $A$
    \item[c.] Show $A$ has no pumping length
    \item[d.] Show $A$ is undecidable
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

{\bf Example}: What is the language generated by the CFG with rules
\begin{align*}
    S &\to aSb \mid bY \mid Ya \\
    Y &\to bY \mid Ya \mid \varepsilon 
\end{align*}

\newpage

{\bf Example}: Prove that the language 
$T = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid \textrm{$M$ is a Turing machine and $L(M)$ is infinite}\}$ 
is undecidable.

\newpage

{\bf Example}: Prove that the class of decidable languages is closed under concatenation.
