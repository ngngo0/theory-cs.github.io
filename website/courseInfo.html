  <!-- Overview -->
  <div class="row">
    <h1>Theory of Computation
    </h1>
    <h2>CSE105Sp22</h2>
    <h3>
      Is there a problem that NO computer can ever solve?<br>
      
      What resources are needed to solve a problem?<br>
      
      Are some problems harder than others? <br>
    </h3>
    <p>In this course, we will explore what it means to be "computable". We begin with a very simple model of
      computation, and work our way to the most powerful, the Turing machine, named after 
      <strong>Alan Turing</strong>, 
      who formalized the notion of "algorithm" <i>even before there were any physical computers</i>.
      You'll also learn about the relationship of these models to some essential tools in a computer 
      scientist's toolkit, such as regular expressions and context-free grammars. Finally, you'll develop 
      your technical communication skills in writing formal arguments and proofs. 
    </p>
    <p>Use our <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a> to get links to
      class times and notes. Submit your work for this class on
      <a href="http://gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
      Reach out to me (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) or one of the other
      <a href="courseInfo.html#team" aria-label="Contact a team member">CSE 105 team members</a>
      if you have questions.
      This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion; find our class page
      <a href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/spring2022/cse105/home" aria-label="Go to Piazza">on Piazza</a>; 
      one thing Piazza is particularly good for is finding homework group mates. Some of the homework in 
      this class will be group-work optional; students in previous versions of the class often found group
      conversations helped them learn the material more deeply, and were fun. Choosing to
      engage in groupwork is also supported by current work in CS Education Research:

  <!-- Syllabus -->
  <div class="row">
    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
    <p>Here are our plans for CSE 105 this quarter, keeping in mind we may need to be flexible
      in response to campus and public health guidance.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li>We will provide all required material for this class on this website. Lecture
        material is available in PDF, tex, and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
        it if you'd like. In class, we'll explore concepts and work through examples.
        Sometimes, we'll think through
        multiple choice questions individually or in small groups so you can
        test and deepen your understanding.
        Other examples will be open-ended problems to practice the critical thinking and communication
        skills we are developing in CSE 105.</li>
      <li>Lectures are scheduled for MWF 9am-9:50am. Please fill out the pre-class survey
        that was sent to your @ucsd.edu email so that we can learn about your preferences
        and needs for this quarter; you can also find a link to your survey on our
        <a href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu" aria-label="Go to Canvas" target="_blank">Canvas</a> page.
        Lectures will be recorded and posted on <a href="http://podcast.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">
          podcast.ucsd.edu</a>, and linked from 
        <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Review quizzes based on class material are assigned each day. These quizzes will help you
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we work in class.
        Quizzes can be submitted on Gradescope as many times (with no penalty) as you like until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty late submission open until Sunday). </li>
      <li>We maintain a <a href="overview_calendar.html#officehours">calendar of drop-in help hours</a>: check each listing to
        see whether the drop-in help hours session is offered in-person or remote. Location or Zoom link
        will be in the event description. You can also reach out to me directly by email: minnes@eng.ucsd.edu .
        <em>I'm happy for you to address me as Prof. Minnes, Dr. Minnes,
          and/or Mia. My pronouns are she/her/hers. Please do not use the title Ms./ Mrs. for me</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Discussion sections will include a review
        of the lecture material for the week and example problems. They are
        scheduled for Mondays at 3pm in WLH 2001.</li>
      <li>We learn by doing: your primary out-of-class work for this class will be weekly
        homework assignments and a project, along with a final exam. These assessments will
        be your opportunity to practice using precise tools to represent and solve technical
        problems and to communicate your solutions.

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <p>We encourage you to work on homework in groups of up to three CSE 105 classmates. 
      To find group members: reach out to
      people sitting around you in class, in discussion section, or during office hours. The pre-survey
      also asks if you want help finding group members: the CSE 105 instructional team can help you connect with
      other students. Working within the campus safety guidelines, you may choose to meet with your
      group mates in person (find ideas for
      <a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/technology/campus-study-locations.html" target="_blank" )>
        where to study on campus</a>), or online. If you're working with one another remotely, we highly recommend
      meeting synchronously so that you can work through the homework problems *together*. Your @ucsd.edu account
      gives you access to Zoom, login at <a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/" aria-label="Go to UCSD Zoom login page"
        target="_blank">https://ucsd.zoom.us/</a> to schedule a meeting. Pro tip:
      if you change the meeting URL from https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/MEETING-ID to
      https://ucsd.zoom/us/wc/join/MEETING-ID, it will allow the user to join via the browser
      and not just through the app. The <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/categories/200101697"
        target="_blank">Zoom support page</a> has details on hosting and joining meetings.
    </p>

    <h3>Textbook and supplies</h3>

    <p>
      Lecture material is available in PDF and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
      it if you'd like. If you would like a hard copy of the notes and don't have access to a printer, please 
      let me know (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu).
    </p>

    <p>The <b>required</b> textbook for this course is <b>Sipser, Michael </b> &nbsp; 
      <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation </i>
            I highly recommend this book for the class - it's very well-written and we'll be using it extensively.
      
      A digital copy may be available through Cengage unlimited (linked from Canvas). 
      For a physical copy, the Third Edition (international) of this book is available at the UCSD Bookstore 
      for approximately 20 dollars. I also have a number of copies of the textbook available to borrow for the term 
      if you have difficulty accessing the book. Please reach out (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) to arrange a time to 
      pick up a copy.</p>
      
      <p>To brush up on proofs, use:  Richard Hammack, <i> Book of Proof, 2nd ed.</i> 
        (available for download <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof" target="_blank"> here</a>).
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are multiple  tools to help you visualize and test finite state machines, the foundational computer models 
      we are studying in this class.  
      We will support two of these tools in CSE 105 this quarter: JFLAP and flap.js. JFLAP was developed starting in the 1990s 
      by a team led by Susan Rodger (RPI, then Duke).  It is now a mature tool with a lot  of functionality. Some  
      of the conventions and notation it uses  differ from the  course textbook for  CSE 105. 
      The second tool, flap.js, is a webapp under development by a group of UCSD students that is being piloted in CSE 105. 
      It is being customized  for use in this class.  Let me know 
      if you're interested in joining the development team for flap.js to help future CSE 105 students.</p>
      
      <h4>flap.js</h4>
      <p>The homepage for the tool is at <a href="https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp//" target="_blank">https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp/</a>; a 
      <a href="https://github.com/flapjs/FLAPJS-WebApp/blob/master/docs/HELP.md" target="_blank">detailed tutorial</a> is  available here. 
      It currently has many features for designing and working with DFA and NFA.  The module on PDA allows you to draw state diagrams.</p>
      
      <h4>JFLAP</h4>
      <p>The homepage for the tool is at <a href="http://www.jflap.org/" target="_blank">www.jflap.org</a>; the current 
      stable version is version 7.1.</p>
      
      <h4>JFLAP: Basic installation and configuration</h4> 
      <p>For those who already have Java Virtual Machine installed. NOTE: you should be able to install JFLAP on systems with 
        JVM even if you don't have install/Administrator rights.
      <ul>
      <li>Download the <a href="http://www2.cs.duke.edu/csed/jflap/log/form.php" target="_blank">JFLAP.jar file</a> from Duke University.</li>
      <li>Double-click it to run JFLAP. If it doesn't launch, that probably means you don't have JVM installed. See instructions below.</li>
      <li>Go to Preferences, then select "Set the Empty String Character," and change it from "Lambda" to "Epsilon." 
        This will make JFLAP match the notation we use in the book and in class for the empty string character.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>If you don't already have JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed on your computer</h5>
      <p>You'll need to get the JVM in order to run JFLAP. You will need install/Administrator rights to do this. To install:
      <ul>
      <li>Go <a href="https://java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">here</a> for the latest version of Java.</li>
      <li>Download JDK 8 for your personal machine.</li>
      <li>After downloading, run the file (double-click) to install.</li>
      <li>After the install is finished, you may need to reboot.</li>
      <li>Now follow the "Basic Install and Configuration" instructions above to install and configure JFLAP.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h5><b>Frequently asked questions about JFLAP</b></h5>
      <p><b>Regular Expressions</b> Do not use whitespace in your regular expressions unless a 
        space is a valid symbol in the alphabet. JFLAP uses a + symbol instead of the U used in the textbook 
      to indicate union.</p>
      
      <p><b>Start and Accept States</b> Don't forget to specify these when drawing your automata!</p>
      
      <p><b>Multiple Transitions</b> If you need multiple possible inputs for the same arrow in your diagram 
        (e.g. if you can move between states on either a 0 or a 1), this is done by creating separate edges in JFLAP 
        for each input symbol. JFLAP will combine these into one arrow on your diagram. Automata with transitions 
        labeled with a comma (e.g. "0,1") are not equivalent, because those transitions will not be followed unless 
        "0,1" actually appears in your input string.</p>
      
      <p><b>Empty String</b> In class and in the text, we use ε (epsilon) to denote the empty string. The instructions 
        above help you change the JFLAP default λ (lambda) to match our conventions. If you need a state transition 
        (or a stack symbol for PDA's) for ε, do not enter any characters into the text box for that transition and ε will appear. 
        Entering a space does not work; that transition will be followed only if the input string has a space on it. 
        Similarly, entering E or "epsilon" will not work because JFLAP will try to match those exact symbols in your 
        input string for the transition.</p>
      
      <p><b>Push Down Automata</b> Each transition has three labels: an input symbol, a stack symbol to pop, 
        and a stack symbol to push. JFLAP uses the semicolon (;) instead of a right arrow to separate the stack symbols. 
        Any of the three labels can be the empty string. Settings: Your PDAs should be "Single Character Input" 
        (this option appears when you first create an automaton), and they should accept by final state, not by empty stack.</p>
      
      <p><b>Context Free Grammars</b> If you have a production rule of the form "S -> A | B", enter it as two rules 
        "S -> A" and "S -> B".</p>
      
      
    <h3>Typesetting (LaTeX) Resources</h3>
    <p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and
      scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you
      like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might
      find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used
      widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX
      and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions.</p>

    <p>If you have never used LaTeX, we recommend cloud resources
      that don't require you to download and install LaTeX on your local machine.
      A good example is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Overleaf">Overleaf</a>,
      which has lots of <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn" target="_blank"
        aria-label="Overleaf documentation">documentation</a>. Overleaf works similar to Google Docs
      in that all members can edit the file in parallel and changes are updated in real time.
      There is a way to directly invite group members to your document, but the free
      version of Overleaf only allows two people to work at the same time.
      To get around this, turn on link sharing: Click on “Share” in the top right,
      Click “Turn on link sharing”, Copy the displayed link and share it with your group members.
      To export your work, click on the “Download PDF” button on the right-hand side
      If you want to export the raw source files, click on the “Menu” button in the top-left, then click on “Source”

    <p>This <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">open source LaTeX reference</a>
      can be helpful when getting started,
      and you can use the .tex source of all the files we use in class as templates.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can use Google Docs, which is available through your @ucsd.edu account.
      You can create documents and then share them with your group members with manual invites
      or a shareable link. Google Docs has a LaTex add-on that lets you type formulas in
      a math typesetting environment: search for "Auto-LaTeX Equations" if you want to try this option.
      You'll need to use the display environment (start and end with $) for all the
      portions you want rendered with LaTeX.

    <h2 style="line-height: 20px;"><br><br>Grading and academic integrity<br><br><br></h2>

    <p>Grades in this class are designed to reflect your work and to document evidence of your learning this core
      material.
      quarter of building the foundations needed for your continued development in Computer Science.
      Please reach out to me (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have extenuating circumstances that you think will impede your
      ability to participate in the planned CSE 105 activities; I'd like to work out a solution together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The graded components for CSE 105 will be Review quizzes, Homework, Project, and Final exam.
      Your overall grade for CSE 105 will be computed using the weights
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li><a href="http://www.gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope"><b>Review quizzes</b></a>: 
        15% of overall score. You will need to achieve a passing grade
        (70%) with integrity on the
        review quiz component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To help you
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we work in class
        and give you immediate feedback.</em><br>
        <em>How?</em> Quizzes can be submitted as many times (with no penalty) as you like
        until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with late submission open until Sunday; 
        no penalty for late submission of quizzes).
        The lowest three quiz scores will not be
        included in your overall review quiz average. You can collaborate with other CSE 105
        students on review quizzes and you can ask questions about them in public
        posts on Piazza and in drop-in help hours.<br><br>

      </li>
      <li><a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page"><b>Homework</b></a>: 35% of overall score. You will need to achieve a passing grade
        (70%) with integrity on the homework
        component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to
        know and learn from your classmates.<br>
        <em>How?</em> Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
        You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments.
        The lowest HW score will not be included in your
        overall HW average. Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s)
        are clearly visible on the first page of your homework
        submission and then upload the PDF to
        <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
        If working in a group, <b>submit only one submission per group</b>: one partner uploads the
        submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission
        by selecting their name(s) in the "Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s)
        every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
        <b>correctness</b> (including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all answers) or
        <b>fair effort completeness</b>. You may only collaborate on HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your
        group has questions about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
        post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.<br><br>
      </li>

      <li><a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page"><b>Project</b></a>: 30% of overall score. 
        You will need to achieve a passing grade (70%) with integrity on the project
        component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To go deeper and extend your work on assignments and to explore an application of your
        choosing.<br>

        <em>How?</em> During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we discovered
        that video assessment and some open-ended personalized projects help ensure fairness
        and can be less stressful for students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project
        submission also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to class calendar"><b>Final</b></a>: 20% of overall score. 
        You will need to achieve a passing grade
        (70%) with integrity on the final
        component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

      <em>Why?</em> To review the entire quarter and solidify your understanding of CSE 105's foundational
      material.</em><br>

      <em>How?</em> Cumulative test on class content during exam week.
      The exam must reflect your own independent effort. The exam may have a combination of True/False, multiple
      choice, select-all-that-apply, and free-response questions.</em>

    <p>The UC San Diego Academic Integrity pledge is
      <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-pledge.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Academic integrity violations will be taken seriously and reported to the campus-wide Academic Integrity Office.
      Key facts about academic integrity related to CSE 105:
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li>Use only resources explicitly allowed for each assignment. Resources not affiliated with this quarter's
        version of the class may use inconsistent notation or definitions. If you need help, please reach out to the
        instructor, TAs, and tutors.</li>
      <li>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with other students in the class who are not
        in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in the class.</li>
      <li>Before and during taking any individual assessment, do not attempt to obtain information about the contents of
        the exam from students who have already taken it or from any nonauthorized source.</li>
      <li>You may not ask for help from anyone while taking individual assessments since they are intended to reflect
        <i>your own</i> mastery of the material. In particular, you may not collaborate on exam questions with other
        students in the class and you may not post any portion of the exam on forums where others may assist you.
      </li>
      <li>After taking an exam or quiz, do not discuss its contents with anyone in the class
        who has not yet taken it. Do not post information about it or share information about it with others who haven't
        taken it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <h3>Regrades</h3>
    <p>Regrades need to be requested within three days of announcement of grades. The regrade window will
      be set in <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
      In the regrade request, include a brief but detailed explanation of why you
      think there was an error in the grading. A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may
      lead to the score
      being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading. All regrades will
      be considered once the regrade window closes; thank you in advance for your patience while we
      carefully look through them.</p>


    <h3>Accommodations for students with disabilities</h3>
    <p>We would like to work with each of you to make this course accessible
      and approachable. All course material is available in multiple formats
      to improve support for screen readers. Videos will also be captioned (to the
      best of our abilities). We need to hear from you if additional accommodations
      would improve your experience in the course.

      If you have documented need for accommodations because of a disability,
      please work with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)
      to get a current Authorization for
      Accommodation (AFA) letter. The office is located in
      University Center 202 behind Center Hall and also provides
      the <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/sso/osdsp/home" target="_blank">OSD Student Portal</a>. We ask that
      you work
      to organize the AFA and to let us know about it as early in the quarter as possible
      so that we can best support your needs.
