    <h1>Theory of Computation
    </h1>
    <h2>CSE105W24</h2>
    <h3>
      Is there a problem that NO computer can ever solve?<br>
      
      What resources are needed to solve a problem?<br>
      
      Are some problems harder than others? <br>
    </h3>
    <p>In this course, we will explore what it means to be "computable".
    </p>
    <p>We begin with a very constrained model of
      computation, and work our way to the most powerful, the Turing machine. We'll see how remarkable 
      this model is in terms of how much it captures about the capabilities of computation, even though 
      it appears far removed from implementation. 
      <strong>Alan Turing</strong>
       formalized the notion of "algorithm" using this model <i>even before there were any physical computers</i>.
       Remarkably, it is still relevant today and is equivalent to super computers and quantum computers!
      </p>
      <p>
      We'll also explore the relationship of these models to some essential tools in a computer 
      scientist's toolkit, such as regular expressions and reductions. Throughout the course, you'll develop 
      your technical communication skills in writing formal arguments and proofs. 
    </p>
    <!-- Syllabus -->
    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pre-class survey</dt><dd>Please fill out the pre-class survey
        that was sent to your @ucsd.edu email so that we can learn about your preferences
        and needs for this quarter; you can also find a link to this survey on our
        <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/51649" aria-label="Go to Canvas" target="_blank">Canvas</a> page
        as the <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/51649/quizzes/158899" aria-label="Go to FinAid assignment" target="_blank">#FinAid assignment</a> for this quarter.</dd>
      <dt>Notes and resources</dt><dd>Use our <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a> to get links to
      class times and notes. Lecture
      material is available in PDF, tex, and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
      it if you'd like. In class, we'll explore concepts and work through examples.
      There will often be some <a href="#textbook">pre-class reading</a> (listed on the notes PDF) to help you prepare for class.
      The reading is often just a few lines of text or an example in the book and will be very helpful so we can jump into 
      problem solving in class. You can also watch the posted supplementary videos listed with
      <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">each week</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Learn by doing</dt><dd> After each class, you'll work on 
        review quizzes to
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we covered in class.
        Quizzes can be submitted on <a href="http://gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope" target="_blank">Gradescope</a> 
        as many times (with no penalty) as you like until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty late submission open until Sunday).
        Open-ended (group-optional) homework assignments will stretch your understanding and 
        will ask you to put together complete, coherent, convincing explanations.
        There will also be a project and two (in person, synchronous) tests.
        In each of these <a href="#grades">assessments</a>
        you will practice using precise tools to represent and solve technical
        problems and to communicate your solutions, and you will get feedback on your work.</dd>
      <dt>Collaborate</dt><dd> 
        In-class, in office hours, and on the online discussion board, we encourage you to discuss
        the course concepts and examples. Review quiz questions are open to collaboration with everyone 
        in CSE 105. 
        To get the maximum benefit from working on homework assignments, we encourage you to find a group
        to work with.
        Students in previous versions of the class often found group
        conversations helped them learn the material more deeply, and were fun 
        (and also an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478431.3499286" target="_blank">evidence-based practice</a> for learning).
        To find group members: reach out to
        people sitting around you in class, in discussion section, or during office hours; you 
        can also use the "find teammate" tool on Piazza. The pre-survey
        asks if you want help finding group members: the CSE 105 instructional team can help you connect with
        other students. We highly recommend
        meeting synchronously so that your group can work through the homework problems *together*
        (<a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/technology/campus-study-locations.html" target="_blank" )>
          in person</a> or online).
        Questions in homework assignments that are labelled "graded for correctness" 
        (rather than for "fair effort completeness") should only be discussed with your group members
        and the CSE 105 instructional team.
        The project assignment will be completed individually.</dd>
    <dt>Ask for help</dt><dd>Reach out to the CSE 105 team
      if you have questions. The CSE 105 instructional team this quarter is one instructor (Mia Minnes), 
      two TAs (Rachel Lim and Xinsong Lin), 
      and eleven tutors.
      On our Canvas page, select "People" and filter by "Roles" to see our names, contact information, and brief profiles.
      This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion; you can access Piazza through our Canvas 
      site or <a href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2024/cse105_wi24_a00/" aria-label="Piazza discussion board">directly</a>
      (the Piazza roster is synced to the Registrar class list and waitlist). Drop-in (in person
      and Zoom) Q&A times are listed on the <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a> page.
      You can also reach out to your instructor directly by email: minnes@ucsd.edu .
      <em>To address me, please use Prof. Minnes, Dr. Minnes,
        and/or Mia (with pronouns she/her), as you feel comfortable. 
        Please do not use the title Ms./ Mrs. for me</em>.

  <!-- Resources -->
  <div class="row">
    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <a name="textbook"></a>
    <h3>Textbook and lecture resources</h3>

    <p>
      Lecture material is available in PDF and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
      it if you'd like. If you would like a hard copy of the notes and don't have access to a printer, please 
      let your instructor know (minnes@ucsd.edu).
    </p>

    <p>The <b>required</b> textbook for this course is <b>Sipser, Michael </b> 
      <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation </i>.
      We highly recommend this book for the class - it's very well-written and we'll be using it extensively.
      
      For a physical copy, the Third Edition of this book is available through multiple vendors;
      we've seen it listed online for approximately 30 dollars. 
      I also have a number of copies of the textbook available to borrow for the term 
      if you have difficulty accessing the book. Please reach out (minnes@ucsd.edu) to arrange a time to 
      pick up a copy.</p>
      
      <p>To brush up on proofs, you can refer to:  Richard Hammack, <i> Book of Proof, 2nd ed.</i> 
        (available for download <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof" target="_blank"> here</a>).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Typesetting (LaTeX) Resources</h3>
      <p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and
        scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you
        like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.). You might
        find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used
        widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignment prompts are typed using LaTeX
        and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions (click the "LaTeX" 
        button at the top of each assignment on the <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a> page to 
        download the source files).</p>
  
      <p>If you have never used LaTeX, we recommend cloud resources
        that don't require you to download and install LaTeX on your local machine.
        A good example is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Overleaf">Overleaf</a>,
        which has lots of <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn" target="_blank"
          aria-label="Overleaf documentation">documentation</a>. Overleaf works similar to Google Docs
        in that all members can edit the file in parallel and changes are updated in real time.
        There is a way to directly invite group members to your document, but the free
        version of Overleaf only allows two people to work at the same time.
        If your group has 3 people, you can turn on link sharing: Click on “Share” in the top right,
        Click “Turn on link sharing”, Copy the displayed link and share it with your group members.
        To export your work, click on the “Download PDF” button on the right-hand side.
        If you want to export the raw source files, click on the "Menu" button in the top-left, 
        then click on "Source".
  
      <p>This <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">open source LaTeX reference</a>
        can be helpful when getting started,
        and you can use the .tex source of all the files we use in class as templates.</p>
  
      <p>Alternatively, you can use Google Docs, which is available through your @ucsd.edu account.
        You can create documents and then share them with your group members with manual invites
        or a shareable link. Google Docs has a LaTex add-on that lets you type formulas in
        a math typesetting environment: search for "Auto-LaTeX Equations" if you want to try this option.
        You'll need to use the display environment (start and end with $$) for all the
        portions you want rendered with LaTeX.
      </p>
  
  

      <h3>Software tools for state diagrams and formal models</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://flapjs.web.app/" target="_blank">flap.js</a> is a webapp under development by a group of 
        UCSD students that is being piloted in CSE 105. Click the "Help" icon for a  tutorial for using the app, and 
        hit "Save" to download an image of the diagram you create or to get a permalink for your machine.
        flap.js is being customized for use in this class; the github repo
        is https://github.com/flapjs . You can find older versions of the app there, e.g https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp/ , 
        if you're curious in its development.
        At the end of the quarter, you can also let me know 
        if you're interested in joining the development team for flap.js to help future CSE 105 students.</p>
        
      <p>  
        <a href="https://www.jflap.org/" target="_blank">JFLAP</a> was developed starting in the 1990s 
      by a team led by Susan Rodger (RPI, then Duke).  It is now a mature tool with a lot  of functionality, but some  
      of the conventions and notation it uses are different from the  course textbook for CSE 105. 
      You can follow the instructions on the JFLAP website to download and install the current stable version
      (you may need to install the Java Virtual Machine as well).
      If you use JFLAP, here are some things to keep in mind:
      <dl>
        <dt>Regular expressions</dt><dd>Do not use whitespace in your regular expressions unless a 
          space is a valid symbol in the alphabet. JFLAP uses a + symbol instead of the U used in the textbook 
          to indicate union.</dd>
        <dt>Start and Accept States</dt><dd>Don't forget to specify these when drawing your automata!</dd>
        <dt>Multiple Transitions</dt><dd>If you need multiple possible inputs for the same arrow in your diagram 
          (e.g. if you can move between states on either a 0 or a 1), this is done by creating separate edges in JFLAP 
          for each input symbol. JFLAP will combine these into one arrow on your diagram. Automata with transitions 
          labeled with a comma (e.g. "0,1") are not equivalent, because those transitions will not be followed unless 
          "0,1" actually appears in your input string.</dd>
        <dt>Empty String</dt><dd>In class and in the textbook, we use ε (epsilon) to denote the empty string. The instructions 
            above help you change the JFLAP default λ (lambda) to match our conventions. If you need a state transition 
            (or a stack symbol for PDA's) for ε, do not enter any characters into the text box for that transition and ε will appear. 
            Entering a space does not work; that transition will be followed only if the input string has a space on it. 
            Similarly, entering E or "epsilon" will not work because JFLAP will try to match those exact symbols in your 
            input string for the transition.</dd>
        <dt>Push Down Automata</dt><dd>Each transition has three labels: an input symbol, a stack symbol to pop, 
            and a stack symbol to push. JFLAP uses the semicolon (;) instead of a right arrow to separate the stack symbols. 
            Any of the three labels can be the empty string. Settings: Your PDAs should be "Single Character Input" 
            (this option appears when you first create an automaton), and they should accept by final state, not by empty stack.</dd>
        <dt>Context Free Grammars</dt><dd>If you have a production rule of the form "S -> A | B", enter it as two rules 
          "S -> A" and "S -> B"</dd>
      </dl>
      </p>
      
    <a name="grades"></a>
    <h2 style="line-height: 20px;"><br><br>Grading and academic integrity<br><br><br></h2>

    <p>Grades in this class are designed to reflect your work and to document evidence of your learning this core
      material.
      Please reach out to your instructor (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you face extenuating circumstances that you think will impede your
      ability to participate in the planned CSE 105 activities; I'd like to work out a solution together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The graded components for CSE 105 will be <b>engagement</b>, <b>assignments</b>, <b>tests</b>.
      <dl>
      <dt>Engagement</dt>
      <dd>Engagement in class is reflected in <b>review quizzes</b> available on 
        <a href="http://www.gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
        These quizzes help you
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we work in class
        and give you immediate feedback. They will also sometimes preview upcoming class topics based on the assigned
        textbook reading. Quizzes can be submitted as many times (with no penalty) as you like
        until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with late submission open until Sunday; 
        no penalty for late submission of quizzes). You can collaborate with other CSE 105
        students on review quizzes and you can ask questions about them in public
        posts on Piazza and in drop-in help hours. You get credit for a quiz by getting most of the questions right. 
        </dd>
      <dt>Assignments</dt>
      <dd>Assignments are biweekly
        homeworks plus one project, all listed on the <a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page">assignments page</a>.
        <b>Homework</b> assignments give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to
        know and learn from your classmates.
        These homework assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
        You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s)
        are clearly visible on the first page of your homework
        submission and then upload the PDF to
        <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
        If you're working in a group, <i>submit only one submission per group</i>: one partner uploads the
        submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission
        by selecting their name(s) in the "Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s)
        every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
        <i>correctness</i> (including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all answers) or
        <i>fair effort completeness</i>. You may only collaborate on "graded for correctness" 
        questions with CSE 105 students in your group; if your
        group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
        post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. In the <b>project</b> you'll 
        go deeper and extend your work to explore an application of your
        choosing. The project is an individual assignment.</dd>
        <dt>Tests</dt>
        <dd>
        There are two <b>tests</b> in the course, one in week 5 and one in week 9, scheduled (in person and synchronous)
        during the Friday afternoon discussion section.
        The scheduled final exam time during finals week will give you an opportunity to retake 
        an equivalent version to one or both of these tests if you miss them or get low scores.
        There are no make-up tests for the tests during the quarter. 
        If you miss an in-class test, you can regain credit for it from that part of the final exam. 
        This policy is designed to encourage you to treat the in-class tests as learning opportunities 
        so that you can study any mistakes you make and re-apply that knowledge on the final.
        In addition, if you score high enough on the tests during the quarter, 
        you can skip the final exam with no penalty and just have the test grades applied to your grade.

        </dd> 
      </dl>
    </p>

    <p>
    At the end of the quarter, grades will be assigned according to the following standards: </p>
      <dl>

  The assigned letter grade will be the highest grade for which the standards are met.
  Engagement is used to add +/- modifiers at the end of the quarter, and won't make the difference between A/B/C etc.
  We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient, but we guarantee that we will not adjust the scale to make it harder to get a better grade.

    <p>The UC San Diego Academic Integrity pledge is
      <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-pledge.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Academic integrity violations will be taken seriously and reported to the campus-wide Academic Integrity Office.
      Key facts about academic integrity related to CSE 105:
    <ul>
      <li>Use only resources explicitly allowed for each assignment. Resources not affiliated with this quarter's
        version of the class may use inconsistent notation or definitions. If you need help, please reach out to the
        instructor, TAs, and tutors.</li>
      <li>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with other students in the class who are not
        in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in the class.</li>
      <li>Before and during taking any individual assessment, do not attempt to obtain information about the contents of
        the test from students who have already taken it or from any nonauthorized source.</li>
      <li>You may not ask for help from anyone while taking individual assessments since they are intended to reflect
        <i>your own</i> mastery of the material. In particular, you may not collaborate on exam questions with other
        students in the class and you may not post any portion of the exam on forums where others may assist you.
      </li>
      <li>After taking an exam or test, do not discuss its contents with anyone in the class
        who has not yet taken it. Do not post information about it or share information about it with others who haven't
        taken it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Regrades</h3>
    <p>The window for requesting regrades once assignment feedback has been published will
      be set in <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>
      and will typically be 2-3 days.
      If you submit a  regrade request, please include a brief but detailed explanation of why you
      think there was an error in the grading. A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire 
      assignment and may lead to the score
      being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading. All regrades will
      be considered once the regrade window closes; thank you in advance for your patience while we
      carefully look through them.</p>


    <h3>Accommodations for students with disabilities</h3>
    <p>We would like to work with each of you to make this course accessible
      and approachable. All course material is available in multiple formats
      to improve support for screen readers. Videos will also be captioned (to the
      best of our abilities). We need and want to hear from you if additional accommodations
      would improve your experience in the course.

      If you have documented need for accommodations because of a disability,
      please work with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)
      to get a current Authorization for
      Accommodation (AFA) letter. The office is located in
      University Center 202 behind Center Hall and also provides
      the <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/sso/osdsp/home" target="_blank">OSD Student Portal</a>. 
      We ask that you work
      to organize the AFA and to let us know about it as early in the quarter as possible
      so that we can best support your needs.
