<h1 class="title">HW4: Context-free Languages and Turing Machines</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Due: 5/5/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until 8am
next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing and working with context-free grammars
and pushdown automata. You will use general constructions to explore the
class of context-free languages. You will also practice with the formal
definition of Turing machines.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 4
and 5. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them
in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (partially). Chapter 2 exercises 2.1, 2.2,
2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16, 2.17. Chapter 2
problem 2.30. Chapter 3 exercises 3.1, 3.2.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key Concepts</strong></span>: Pushdown automata, stack,
context-free grammar, derivations, context-free languages, Turing
machines, halting, looping.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “HW4CSE105Sp22”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>For this question, we are working over the fixed alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Consider the PDA over this alphabet with state diagram</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/machines/hw4PDA.png" style="width:4in"
alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Give an informal description of this PDA and describe the language it
recognizes using set builder notation.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint:</em></span> Compare the PDA with the machine in
Example 2.16 and Figure 2.17 of the textbook (page 116), which
recognizes the language <span class="math inline">\(\{a^i b^j c^k \mid
i,j,k \geq 0 \textrm{ and } i=j \textrm{ or } i=k\}\)</span> and
identify the main differences.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Consider the CFG <span class="math inline">\((\{X, S, S_1, S_2, T,
Y\}, \{a,b,c\}, R, X)\)</span> where the set of rules <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        X &amp;\to aX \mid S \mid T \\
        S &amp;\to S_1S_2 \\
        S_1 &amp;\to aS_1 b \mid \varepsilon \\
        S_2 &amp;\to cS_2 \mid \varepsilon\\
        T &amp;\to aTc \mid Y \\
        Y &amp;\to bY \mid \varepsilon
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>For each of the following strings, either give a derivation in this
grammar that proves the string is in the language generated by the
grammar, or explain why there is no such derivation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(aaaa\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(abbc\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(aabb\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Modify the start
variable of this context-free grammar to get a different CFG (with the
same set of variables, set of terminals, and set of rules) that
generates an <span><strong>infinite regular language</strong></span>, if
possible. A complete solution will include either (1) the formal
definition of this new CFG and an explanation of why the language it
recognizes is both infinite and regular, or (2) a sufficiently general
and correct argument for why there is no way to choose the start
variable to satisfy this requirement.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In this question,
you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for PDAs and
translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math display">\[M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta,
q_0, F)\]</span> is a PDA. We can define a new PDA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(M) = L(N)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is <span><strong>guaranteed to have an
empty stack</strong></span> at the end of any accepting computation.
Informally, the construction is as follows: Add three new states <span
class="math inline">\(q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\)</span> and one new
stack symbol <span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the new states <span
class="math inline">\(q_1&#39;\)</span> will be the new
<span><strong>start</strong></span> state and it has a spontaneous
transition to the old start state <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> which pushes the new stack symbol
<span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> to the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>The transitions between the old states are all the same.</p></li>
<li><p>From each of the old accept states,
<span><strong>add</strong></span> a spontaneous transition (that doesn’t
modify the stack) to the second new state <span
class="math inline">\(q_2&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In this state <span class="math inline">\(q_2&#39;\)</span>, pop
all old stack symbols from the stack without reading any input.</p></li>
<li><p>When the new stack symbol <span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span>
is on the top of the stack, transition to the third new state <span
class="math inline">\(q_3&#39;\)</span> and accept.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\}
\cap Q = \emptyset\)</span> (otherwise, relabel some of the states in
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>) and assume that <span
class="math inline">\(\# \notin \Gamma\)</span> (otherwise, relabel this
stack symbol in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>). Define
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to be <span
class="math display">\[N = ( Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\} ,
\Sigma, \Gamma \cup \{\#\}, \delta_N, q_1&#39;, \{q_3&#39;\} )\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_N : Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;,
q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\}~~\times~~ \Sigma_\varepsilon
~~\times~~\Gamma_\varepsilon\cup \{\#\}
\to \mathcal{P}( Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\} ~~\times
~~\Gamma_\varepsilon\cup \{\#\})\)</span> is defined as <span
class="math display">\[\delta_N ( ~(q, x, y)~) = \begin{cases}
\{ (q_0, \#) \} &amp;\qquad \text{if $q = q_1&#39;$, $x = \varepsilon$,
$y = \varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q, x, y)~)  &amp; \qquad \text{if $q \in Q$, $x \in \Sigma$,
$y \in \Gamma_\varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q, x, y)~)  &amp; \qquad \text{if $q \in Q$, $x=\varepsilon$,
$y \in \Gamma$} \\
\delta( ~(q, x, y)~)  &amp; \qquad \text{if $q \in Q  \setminus F$,
$x=\varepsilon$, $y =\varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q, x, y)~) \cup \{  (q_2&#39;, \varepsilon) \}  &amp; \qquad
\text{if $q \in F$, $x=\varepsilon$, $y =\varepsilon$} \\
\{ (q_2&#39;, \varepsilon)\} &amp; \qquad \text{if $q = q_2&#39;$, $x =
\varepsilon$, $y \in  \Gamma$} \\
\{ (q_3&#39;, \varepsilon)\} &amp; \qquad \text{if $q = q_2&#39;$, $x =
\varepsilon$, $y = \#$} \\
\emptyset &amp; \qquad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this
construction by considering the PDA <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> over the input alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/machines/hw4PDA.png" style="width:5in"
alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>and applying the construction above to create the related PDA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and include its state diagram in your
submission. <span><em>Note: you may include the formal definition of
your PDA, but this is not required.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Pick a string of
length <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> over the alphabet of the
PDA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and use it to demonstrate the
difference in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and in <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>describing an accepting computation of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on this string for which the stack is
not empty at the end of the computation, and</p></li>
<li><p>describing an accepting computation of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> on this string for which the stack is
empty at the end of the computation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your descriptions of these computations, include both the sequence
of states visited by the machine as well as snapshots of the full
contents of the stack at each step in the computation. You may hand-draw
and scan these traces of the computations.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint</em></span>: You will need to pick your example string
wisely. It must be accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
and there must be a computation of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on your string which ends with a
nonempty stack. Not all choices of length <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> strings work.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>)</p>
<p>Fix an arbitrary alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. Prove that the class of
context-free languages over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
is closed under concatenation in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that, for any languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1,
L_2\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, if there
are PDAs <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 = L(M_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L_2 = L(M_2)\)</span>, then there is a PDA that
recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \circ L_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that, for any languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1,
L_2\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, if there
are CFGs <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 = L(G_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L_2 = L(G_2)\)</span>, then there is a CFG that
generates <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \circ L_2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider the Turing machine <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> over the input alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span> with the state diagram
below (the tape alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \{
0,1,X,\square\}\)</span>). Convention: any missing transitions in the
state diagram have value <span
class="math inline">\((qrej,\square,R)\)</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/machines/hw4TM.png" style="width:3.5in"

<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
string <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> of length <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> over <span

either (1) a precise and clear description of your example string and a
precise and clear description of the accepting computation of the Turing
machine on this string or (2) a sufficiently general and correct
argument why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant
definitions.</p>
<p>To describe a computation of a Turing machine, include the contents
of the tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the
read/write head at each step in the computation.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint:</em></span> In class we’ve drawn pictures to
represent the configuration of the machine at each step in a
computation. You may do so or you may choose to describe these
configurations in words.</p></li>
