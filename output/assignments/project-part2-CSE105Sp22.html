<h1 class="title">Project - CSE 105 Spring 2022</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Part 2 due 5/19/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission
until 8am next day)</p>
</header>
<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p>Why? To go deeper and explore the material from Theory of Computation
and how it relates to other aspects of CS and beyond.</p>
<p>How? During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we
discovered that video assessment and some open-ended personalized
projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for students
than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission also gives
flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p><span><strong>Your videos</strong></span>: We will delete all the
videos we receive from you after assigning final grades for the course,
and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory only accessible to the course staff during the quarter. Please
send an email to the instructor (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here: <a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU">Tutorial
URL</a> The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom
is here: <a
href="{https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl}">Video
produced in tutorial</a> .</p>
<p><span><strong>What resources can you use?</strong> </span> This
project must be completed individually, without any help from other
people, including the course staff (other than logistics support if you
get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 105
offering (notes, readings, class videos, supplementary videos, homework
feedback). You may additionally search online to respond to project
parts that explicitly ask you to do so, and you must cite all resources
(online or offline) that you consult as part of this search. Link
directly to the resource and include the name of the author / video
creator and the reason you consulted this reference. The work you submit
for the project needs to be your own.</p>
<p>The written portion of the project is expected to be clearly legible,
and should preferably be typed.</p>
<h1 id="tasks-for-project-part-2">Tasks for Project Part 2</h1>
<h2 id="task-1-explain-a-review-quiz-question-written">Task 1: Explain a
review quiz question (Written)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Select one question from one of the review quizzes from 4/15/22
(Friday of Week 3) to 4/29/22 (Friday of Week 5) to revisit. Include the
problem description, why you picked this question (e.g. what is
interesting about it, what is hard about it, or why you wanted to take a
second look at it), and your solution. Question selection: you can pick
any one question listed in the Gradescope review quizzes, and you must
address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 105 who
missed that week and is “catching up”</p></li>
<li><p>Include at least 2 potential mistakes that a student may have
made while attempting to solve the quiz problem that you selected.
Explain why the reasoning behind these mistakes is flawed so that a
student reading this may learn from these mistakes. It’s a good idea to
include mistakes that you made when you first tried to solve this
problem!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Style guidelines</strong></span>: your written
submission for Task 1 should clearly label the three parts:
<span><em>Question Selection</em></span>,
<span><em>Solution</em></span>, and <span><em>Potential
Mistakes</em></span>.</p>
<h2 id="task-2-closure-of-the-collection-of-regular-languages">Task 2:
Closure of the Collection of Regular Languages</h2>
<p>For this task, we fix <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma =
\{0,1\}\)</span>. Recall that the composition of two functions <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(f \circ g\)</span>, which can also be written as
<span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span>, and is the result of first
applying the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to the
input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (producing <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>), and then applying <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>. Below are some functions with
domain and codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)\)</span>; that is, they each
take in a language over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and
output a language over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        TZ(L) &amp;= \{ w0^k \mid w \in L, k \geq 0 \}\\
        R(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w^R \in L\} \textrm{(where $w^R$ is
reversing $w$, e.g. $(100)^R = 001$)}\\
        E(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w \in L, \textrm{ the length of $w$ is
even} \} \\
        T(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w \in L, \textrm{ the length of $w$ is a
multiple of } 3 \}\\
        EQ(L) &amp;= \{ w^k1^k \mid k \geq 0, w \in L \} \textrm{(where
$w^k$ is concatenating $w$ with itself $k$ times, e.g. $(100)^2 =
100100$)}\\
        LT(L) &amp;= \{ w^k1^j \mid 0 \leq k &lt; j , w \in L \}\\
        EQ2(L) &amp;= \{ w^kx^k \mid k \geq 0, w \in L, x \in L \}
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>For example <span class="math inline">\((TZ \circ R)(L) = TZ(R(L)) =
\{ w^R 0^k | w \in L, k \geq 0\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose two functions from the above list so that their
composition, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, is such that the
collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide a clear and complete definition of your function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. A complete solution will clearly
specify the two functions you chose to compose, the order in which <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> applies them, and a general description
of what the function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> does using
set builder descriptions and/or English prose.
<span><strong>Note:</strong></span> You do not need to apply <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to a language in this step, you only
need to define <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> by writing out the following argument
in detail: Consider an arbitrary regular language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0, 1\}\)</span>. Since it is regular,
it is recognized by a DFA and let <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q,
\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> be such a DFA over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(M) = L\)</span>. Give the formal construction of
an NFA <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(N) = h(L)\)</span> for your function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Briefly justify this construction by
tracing the computations of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
and/or referencing constructions we discussed in class and in the book.
In particular, explain the role of each parameter in the definition of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in the construction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Choose two functions from the above list so that their
composition, <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>, is such that
the collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. <span><em>Note the functions you
choose for this part may or may not overlap with those from the previous
part; it’s up to you to decide.</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide a clear and complete definition of your function <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. A complete solution will clearly
specify the two functions you chose to compose, the order in which <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> applies them, and a general
description of what the function <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> does using set builder
descriptions and/or English prose.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a witness language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>
that can be used to prove that the class of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is not closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. To do so: (1) clearly define a
language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, (2) prove that <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular, and (3) prove that <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;(L)\)</span> is not regular. You may use
results proved in class and / or the relevant sections in the textbook
as part of your proofs if you would like, but you must label these
results and provide references to the day we discussed them and/or the
page number in the book.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-3-implementation-examples-and-video">Task 3: Implementation
examples and Video</h2>
<p>With the introduction of PDAs, our models of computation begin to
approach the power that modern day computers have. Choose a specific
non-regular but context-free language mentioned in some question in the
review quizzes between 4/15/22 (Friday of Week 3) to 4/29/22 (Friday of
Week 5); you will write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, or C++
which is able to test membership of strings in that language. The
program you write should function like a PDA, using a constant amount of
memory plus access to a stack, and should only make a single pass
through the string.</p>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. Create a
3-5 minute screencast video with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>State which language you chose from the review quiz, and show the
state diagram for a PDA which recognizes the language, briefly
justifying why it works.</p></li>
<li><p>State which programming language you chose to use and show on the
screen all the code your wrote to implement the PDA in your chosen
programming language. Discuss how the behavior of your program is
related to the state diagram of the PDA, and discuss the implementation
choices you made when creating this program.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate 4 test cases (2 strings in the language recognized by
your PDA, 2 strings not in this language), clearly defining each one,
explaining the expected behavior of the PDA, and showing the output /
feedback your program gives to indicate whether the expected behavior
matches the actual behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this video along with a written version of Tasks 1
and 2 to Gradescope.</p>
<p><span><strong>Extra exploration (not for credit)</strong></span>:
What would it take to implement context-free grammars in code? Could you
use any of your work from implementaing PDAs?</p>
<h1 id="grading-criteria-and-checklists">Grading Criteria and
checklists</h1>
<p><span><strong>Task 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Submission covers a complete review quiz question from the relevant
weeks (all parts of the question must be addressed for multi-part
questions).</p>
<p>Submission clearly labels review questions, including which day it’s
from and the problem description.</p>
<p>Submission includes why the student picked the problem/ what they
found interesting.</p>
<p>Solution is written (or typed) out in detail step-by-step, with clear
and correct logic and justification.</p>
<p>Submission includes 2 potential mistakes that a student might make
while solving this question and explains why they are wrong.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Question 1</em></span>:</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is described
clearly and completely, using appropriate notation and terminology.</p>
<p>The formal construction of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is
clear, correct, and complete, and is justified appropriately and
correctly.</p>
<p><span><em>Question 2</em></span>:</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> is described
clearly and completely, using appropriate notation and terminology.</p>
<p>The language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is specified
clearly and completely and is a viable witness for the proof.</p>
<p>The proof that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular is
clear, correct, and complete.</p>
<p>The proof that <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;(L)\)</span> is not
regular is clear, correct, and complete.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 3</strong></span></p>
<p>Logistics Items</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Video loads correctly</p></li>
<li><p>Video is between 3 and 5 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Video shows the student’s face and ID, and they introduce
themself audibly while on screen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The video clearly states which language was chosen for study, and
references a specific review quiz with this language.</p>
<p>The video shows the state diagram of a PDA which recognizes the
chosen language.</p>
<p>The video clearly describes which programming language was chosen for
the implementaiton and gives the reasons why.</p>
<p>The video discusses the connections between the state diagram of the
PDA and its implementation in the code.</p>
<p>The video clearly demonstrates all test cases, including both
expected and actual output. The video should include screencasts of
running the code live to demonstrate these test cases.</p>
