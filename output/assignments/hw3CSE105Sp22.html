<h1 class="title">HW3 : Nonregular Languages and Pushdown Automata</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Due: 4/28/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice distinguishing between regular and nonregular
languages using both closure arguments and the pumping lemma. You will
also practice with the definition of pushdown automata.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 2
through Week 4. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers
to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 1.4, 2.2. Chapter 1 exercises 1.29, 1.30. Chapter 1
problems 1.49, 1.50, 1.51. Chapter 2 exercises 2.5, 2.7.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key Concepts</strong></span>: Pumping lemma, pumping
length, regular languages, nonregular languages, pushdown automata,
stack.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “HW3CSE105Sp22”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and has length greater than or equal
to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> ought to be pump’able. That is, there
should be a way of dividing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into
parts <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in X_1\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> is nonregular.</p>

<li><p>The language <span class="math inline">\(X_2 = \{ u0w \mid
\text{$u$ and

using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^{p} 0^{p+1}\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w

for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in X_2\)</span>. When <span
class="math inline">\(x = \varepsilon\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 1^{p}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0^{p+1}\)</span>, we have satisfied that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
positive) and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>. If we
let <span class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get the string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz = 1^{2p}0^{p+1}\)</span> that is not in
<span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> because its middle symbol is a
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, not a <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping

</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In the first
week’s homework, we saw the definitions of two functions on the set of
languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>: for <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a set of strings over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, we can define the
following associated sets <span class="math display">\[LZ(L) = \{ 0^k w

class="math display">\[TZ(L) = \{ w 0^k \mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z},
k \geq 0 \}\]</span> This week we’ll just focus on <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L)\)</span>. In class and in the reading so
far, we’ve seen the following examples of nonregular languages:</p>
<div class="multicols">

<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Use (some of) the sets above, along with any regular sets you would
like, to prove or disprove the statement: “The class of nonregular
languages is closed under the function <span
class="math inline">\(LZ\)</span>.”</p>
<p>A complete solution will include a precise description of whether the
statement is true or false, referring back to the definition of closure,
the definition of the function <span class="math inline">\(LZ\)</span>,
and the definition of nonregularity. You may use any claims we proved in
class or that are proved in the textbook reading, so long as you
reference them clearly in your argument by referring to a specific page
