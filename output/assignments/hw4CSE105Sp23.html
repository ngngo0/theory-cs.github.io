<h1 class="title">HW4 : Pushdown Automata and Context-free grammars</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp23</p>
<p class="date">Due: May 2nd at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><strong>In this assignment:</strong></p>
<p>You will practice with the definition of pushdown automata and
context-free grammars and reason about regular and context-free
languages.</p>
<p><em>Resources</em>: To review the topics you are working with for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 3 through Week 4. We
will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><em>Reading and extra practice problems</em>: Sipser Sections 2.1,
2.2. Chapter 2 exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10,
2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16, 2.17.</p>
<p><em>Key Concepts:</em> Pushdown automata, stack, context-free
grammars, derivations, context-free languages.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The lowest HW score
will not be included in your overall HW average. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on HW
with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions about a
HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private post
(visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions (aligned with the textbook) and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4CSE105Sp23”.</p>
<p><strong>Requests from your TAs and tutors</strong> To help us with
grading please</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start each question on a new page.</p></li>
<li><p>Label the start of each solution with
<span><strong>Answer</strong></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assigned questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>A PDA with multiple possibilities</strong> (22
points):<br />
Consider the PDA with input and stack alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}\)</span> whose “unfinished"
state diagram is given below:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>There are three labels (<span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span>) on the edges that are unspecified.
To be precise, each <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> is of the
form “<span class="math inline">\(x,y; z\)</span>” where <span
class="math inline">\(x, y, z \in \Gamma_{\varepsilon}\)</span> (recall
<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{\varepsilon} = \Gamma \cup
\{\varepsilon\}\)</span>).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Prove that (no matter how the labels <span class="math inline">\(E_1,
E_2, E_3\)</span> are specified), the language recognized by this PDA is
infinite. A complete solution will include a precise description of an
infinite collection of strings each of which is accepted by the PDA,
with a precise and clear description of the accepting computation of the
PDA on each of these strings.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Prove/Disprove: Over all the possible choices for the labels <span
class="math inline">\(E_1, E_2, E_3\)</span>, this PDA can only
recognize finitely many languages. Justify your solution by referring
back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall that for
<span class="math inline">\(L \subseteq \Sigma^*\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we define <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \textsc{Rep}(L) &amp;:= \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{between every
pair of successive $2$&#39;s in $w$ is a string in $L$}\}\\
    &amp;\phantom{:}=\{w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{for all } v \in
\Sigma^* \text{ if } 2v2 \in \textsc{Substring}(\{w\})  \text{, then } v
\in L\}
    
\end{aligned}\]</span> where for all languages <span
class="math inline">\(K \subseteq \Gamma^*\)</span> we let <span
class="math display">\[\textsc{Substring}(K) := \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid
\text{there exist } a,b \in \Gamma^* \text{ such that } awb \in
K\}.\]</span></p>
<p>Determine how to set the labels <span class="math inline">\(E_1, E_2,
E_3\)</span> so that the language of the PDA is <span
class="math display">\[\textsc{Rep}(\{0^n1^m \mid n \ge 0, m \ge
0\})\]</span> In addition to specifying each <span
class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>, a complete justification will
include a precise description of why this choice of the <span
class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>’s means that the PDA recognizes the
language indicated.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Determine how to

choice of the <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>’s means that the

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Grammar practice</strong> (12 points):<br />
For each of the languages listed below, define a context-free grammar
<span class="math inline">\(G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)\)</span> that
generates the language. Instead of formally justifying your grammar,
illustrate it by giving <span><strong>two examples</strong></span> of
strings in the language and their derivations using your grammar and
<span><strong>one example</strong></span> of a string not in the
language with an explanation of why it cannot appear on the right side
of any derivation in your grammar. Choose your examples so they are
different enough to illustrate the role of as many of the variables in
your grammar as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Rep}(\{0^n1^n \mid n \ge
0\})\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <span
class="math inline">\(\{1^n = 1^a + 1^b \in \{1,=,+\}^* \mid a,b,n \ge 1
\text{ such that } a + b = n \}\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Substrings and regularity</strong> (16 points):<br />
For this problem, we fix the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma
= \{0,1,2\}\)</span>. Recall the definition of the function <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}\)</span> from Problem 1.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}(\{ 0^n 1^n \mid n \ge
0\})\)</span> is regular. A complete solution will include a precise
definition of a DFA, NFA, or regular expression that recognizes or
describes it, along with a brief justification of your construction by
explaining the role each state plays in the machine and referring back
to relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}(\{ 0^n 1^n 2^n \mid n \ge
0\})\)</span> is not regular.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Is <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}(\{ 0^n 1^n 2^n \mid n \ge
0\})\)</span> context-free? Informally justify your answer, referring to
class discussions and/or the textbook.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>This means your solution will be evaluated not only on
the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your
ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Whether you use
formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why
something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your
goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are
sound.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>This means you will get full credit so long as your
submission demonstrates honest effort to answer the question. You will
not be penalized for incorrect answers. To demonstrate your honest
effort in answering the question, we ask that you include your attempt
to answer *each* part of the question. If you get stuck with your
attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by explaining where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.<a href="#fnref2"
