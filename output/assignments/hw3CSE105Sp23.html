<h1 class="title">HW3 : Nonregular Languages and Pushdown Automata</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp23</p>
<p class="date">Due: April 25th at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><strong>In this assignment:</strong></p>
<p>You will practice distinguishing between regular and nonregular
languages using both closure arguments and the pumping lemma.</p>
<p><em>Resources</em>: To review the topics you are working with for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 2 through Week 4. We
will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><em>Reading and extra practice problems</em>: Sipser Section 1.4,
2.2. Chapter 1 exercises 1.29, 1.30. Chapter 1 problems 1.49, 1.50,
1.51.</p>
<p><em>Key Concepts:</em> Pumping lemma, pumping length, regular
languages, nonregular languages, pushdown automata, stack.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The lowest HW score
will not be included in your overall HW average. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on HW
with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions about a
HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private post
(visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions (aligned with the textbook) and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw3CSE105Sp23”.</p>
<p><strong>Requests from your TAs and tutors</strong> To help us with
grading please</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start each question on a new page.</p></li>
<li><p>Label the start of each solution with
<span><strong>Answer</strong></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assigned questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular or not?</strong> (21 points):<br />
Fix <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}\)</span>. For each of the
languages listed below, prove that it is either regular or nonregular.
<span><em>Note:</em></span> You might find it useful to explore the
definition of each set and consider alternate (simpler) ways of stating
it.</p>
<p>For each language that is regular, a complete solution will include a
precise definition of a DFA, NFA, or regular expression that recognizes
or describes it, along with a brief justification of your construction
by explaining the role each state plays in the machine or referring back
to relevant definitions.</p>
<p>For each language that is nonregular, a complete solution will use
the pumping lemma to prove that it is nonregular, including appropriate
justification related to the specific language.</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Pumping dilemma</strong> (8 points):<br />
Your friend claims that the Pumping Lemma is useless for proving that an
infinite language <span class="math inline">\(K \subseteq
\Sigma^*\)</span> is not regular. Their logic goes like this</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is regular.
It can be recognized by a DFA <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q,
\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For arbitrary DFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the
pumping length <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is at least <span
class="math inline">\(|Q|\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, for every integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge
|Q|\)</span>, there exists a machine <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;
= (Q&#39;, \Sigma, \delta&#39;, q_0&#39;, F&#39;)\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(L(M&#39;) = L(M) = K\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|Q&#39;| = n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, the Pumping Lemma cannot be used to pump any string of
finite length since its pumping length might be arbitrarily
large.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below, we will examine the steps above in detail. Justify your answer
to each part.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
(Step 1): Is this statement true? In other words, just because we’re
assuming that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is regular a
regular language, does it mean we can assume there is a DFA that
recognizes it?</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) (Step 2): In
general, it’s true that the smallest the pumping length of a language
recognized by a DFA with states <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>
can be is <span class="math inline">\(|Q|\)</span>. Prove this by
finding a specific infinite language <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and a DFA recognizing where <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> cannot have pumping length smaller than
<span class="math inline">\(|Q|\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) (Step 3): This
step is correct; prove the stated version of this statement: For every
integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge |Q|\)</span>, there exists a
machine <span class="math inline">\(M&#39; = (Q&#39;, \Sigma,
\delta&#39;, q_0&#39;, F&#39;)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(L(M&#39;) = L(M)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|Q&#39;| = n\)</span>.</p>
<p>(<em>Challenge; not graded</em>): Define a <em>cycle</em> to be a
sequence of <em>distinct</em> states <span class="math inline">\(q_1,
q_2, \ldots, q_m\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[\delta(q_1, \sigma_1) = q_2, \hspace{1cm}
\delta(q_2, \sigma_2) = q_3, \hspace{.5cm} \ldots,
\hspace{.5cm}\delta(q_m, \sigma_m) = q_1,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_m \in
\Sigma\)</span> are symbols in the alphabet. An objection to the
statement in (Step 3) is that the proof of the Pumping Lemma depends on
the length of the cycles in the DFA rather than the number of states.
That is, increasing the number of states in your DFA might not increase
the pumping length because the length of the smallest cycle stays the
same. Nevertheless, a version of your friend’s statement is still true
whenever you impose this additional cycle constraint: for every integer
<span class="math inline">\(n \ge |Q|\)</span>, there exists a machine
<span class="math inline">\(M&#39; = (Q&#39;, \Sigma, \delta&#39;,
q_0&#39;, F&#39;)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(L(M&#39;) = L(M)\)</span> and the length of the
smallest cycle in the <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> is at
least <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.<br />
Your task is to show that even this more general statement is true for
the simple language <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>
recognized by the DFA below:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>For all <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span>, define a DFA
for this language where the length of the smallest cycle is <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) (Step 4):
Describe why this statement is true/false/misleading.</p></li>
