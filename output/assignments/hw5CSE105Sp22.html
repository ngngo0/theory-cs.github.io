<h1 class="title">HW5: Recognizability, Decidability, Undecidability,
and Reductions</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Due: 5/26/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing and working with Turing machines and
their variants. You will use general constructions and specific machines
to explore the classes of recognizable, decidable, and undecidable
languages. You will use computable functions to relate the difficult
levels of languages via mapping reduction.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 6,
7, 8. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in
a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Chapter 4 exercises 4.1, 4.3, 4.4., 4.5. Chapter 4 Problems 4.29, 4.30,
4.32. Chapter 5 exercises 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7. Chapter 5 problems 5.10,
5.11, 5.16, 5.18.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key Concepts</strong></span>: Formal definitions of
Turing machines, computations of Turing machines, halting computations,
implementation-level descriptions of Turing machines, high-level
descriptions of Turing machines, recognizable languages, decidable
languages, variants of Turing machines, enumerators, nondeterministic
Turing machines, Church-Turing thesis, computational problems,
diagonalization, undecidability, unrecognizability, computable function,
mapping reduction.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “HW5CSE105Sp22”.</p>

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Give an example of a decidable language <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> whose complement is also decidable. A
complete solution will include either (1) a precise definition of the
example language <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and an
explanation of why it is decidable and why its complement is decidable,
or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument for why there is no
way to choose an example language to satisfy this requirement. All
justifications and arguments should connect to the relevant definitions
and the specific concepts being discussed.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a decidable language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and a Turing machine <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_2) = L_2\)</span> but <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> does not decide <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. A complete solution will include
either (1) precise definitions of <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and justifications for why <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_2) = L_2\)</span> and why <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> does not decide <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, or (2) a sufficiently general and
correct argument for why there is no way to choose such a language and
machine. For any machines you discuss, you can choose whether to use
high-level descriptions, implementation level descriptions, or formal
definitions. All justifications and arguments should connect to the
relevant definitions and the specific concepts being discussed.</p></li>

<p>Recall that a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to
be <span><strong>closed</strong></span> under an operation <span
class="math inline">\(OP\)</span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying <span
class="math inline">\(OP\)</span> to them gives an element in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers is
closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers, their
product is also an integer.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> are Turing machines. Consider the
following high-level descriptions of machines that give general
constructions based on <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Consider the following construction of a nondeterministic Turing
machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nondeterministically split <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>
into two pieces, i.e. choose <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(w =  xy\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulate running <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> on
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulate running <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> on
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If both simulations in steps 2 and 3 accept, accept."</p></li>

Turing-recognizable languages is closed under concatenation? Briefly
justify your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following construction of an enumerator:</p>

class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> to be the length of this list
(initially <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 0\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Every time a new string <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is

<li><p>Add this string to the list of strings printed by <span

<li><p>Increment <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> so it stores
the current length of the list.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(j =  1 \ldots

<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(w_j\)</span> be the <span

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>This means your solution will be
evaluated not only on the correctness of your answers, but on your
ability to present your ideas clearly and logically. You should explain
how you arrived at your conclusions, using mathematically sound
reasoning. Whether you use formal proof techniques or write a more
informal argument for why something is true, your answers should always
be well-supported. Your goal should be to convince the reader that your
results and methods are sound.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>This means you will get full credit
so long as your submission demonstrates honest effort to answer the
question. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. To
demonstrate your honest effort in answering the question, we ask that
you include your attempt to answer *each* part of the question. If you
get stuck with your attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by
explaining where you got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.<a
