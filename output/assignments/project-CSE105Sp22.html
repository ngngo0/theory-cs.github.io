<h1 class="title">Project</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Part 1 due TBA; Part 2 due TBA; Part 3 due TBA</p>
</header>
<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> TBA</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last
academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended
personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for
students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission
also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after
assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a
university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the
course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor
(minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a

class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.</p>
<p>The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is
here:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason
you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs
to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than
this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or
notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully
before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 of Project: due TBA</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 of Project: due TBA</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3 of Project: due TBA</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="video-component">Video component</h3>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and
your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a
brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work
submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component.
Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>

<li><p>In this part of the project, you will select one question from
one of the review quizzes TBA to revisit. Include the problem statement,
why you picked this question (e.g. what is interesting about it, what is
hard about it, or why you wanted to take a second look at it), and your
solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question selection: you can pick any <span><strong>one
question</strong></span> listed in the Review sections of the relevant
notes documents, and you must address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 20 who
missed that week and is “catching up".</p></li>

<p>You do not need to include complete details of every part of your
solution. It is up to you to choose what is most important so that you
can stick to the timing guidelines and still have time to include
discussing potential mistakes.</p>
<p>Include your face and your student ID (we’d like a photo ID that
includes your name and picture if possible) for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t

the work attached to the video.</p>
