<h1 class="title">Project - CSE 105 Spring 2022</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp23</p>
<p class="date">Due 6/1/23 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until 8am
next day)</p>
</header>
<p>The project component is designed for you to go deeper and extend
your work on assignments and to explore an application of your choosing.
The project is an individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Task 1: A meaningful language (written) and</p></li>
<li><p>Task 2: A helpful function (some programming, presented as a
screencast video).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 105 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them), including any
large-language model style resources. Link directly to them and include
the name of the author / video creator, any search strings or prompts
you used, and the reason you consulted this reference.</p>
<p>The work you submit for the project needs to be your own. Again, you
shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s material and
doing so may result in definitions or notations that conflict with our
norms in this class so think carefully before you go down this path.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="submitting-the-project">Submitting the
project</h3>
<p>You will submit a PDF for Task 1 and a video for Task 2 to an online
assignment on Gradescope.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="task-1-a-meaningful-language">Task 1: A
meaningful language</h2>
<p>Automaton models are useful for concisely representing patterns. In
this question, you’ll choose a pattern in an application you care about,
define it precisely, and then build a DFA, NFA, or PDA that recognizes
it.</p>
<p>First, pick <span><strong>one</strong></span> application for your
example. Here are some ideas to get you started - but you can choose to
go in a different direction all together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data validation for input in text files (e.g. emails with
specific domains, dates in specific formats, PIDs in a class list,
etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finding ASCII codes for punctuation in a binary file.</p></li>
<li><p>The CDC recommended procedure for hand washing (Refer to the
guidelines from the CDC here https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html
in your explanation. You might find the first example in chapter 1 about
automatic door controllers helpful when starting your design.)</p></li>
<li><p>See more ideas here:</p>
<p><span><a
href="https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf"
class="uri">https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf</a></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In a paragraph or so, give the context for your chosen
application and why you chose it.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the alphabet for your example.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a precise (mathematical and/or English) description of a
set of strings over this alphabet that is important, and include a
sentence or so justifying why this set is important.</p></li>
<li><p>Give one example of a string in this set and a string not in this
set, and explain why you chose these example strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Classify your language as regular or context-free, and prove this
classification by giving an appropriate machine that recognizes your
language. Justify your construction.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="grading-criteria-and-checklists">Grading
criteria and checklists</h3>
<p>Solution is typed out in detail step-by-step, with clear and correct
logic and justification.</p>
<p>Each of the five items are included, with precise language and
notation for all terms and complete, correct, and clear
justification.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-a-helpful-function">Task 2: A helpful
function</h2>
<p>To relate the difficulty level of one language to another we use
mapping reduction, which relies on the notion of computable function. In
this part of the project, you will define, program, and trace a specific
computable function from <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}^*\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, choose a function you will be working with. You can pick any
function you like so long as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Its domain is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}^*\)</span> and
its codomain is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}^*\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>There is at least one domain element that is mapped to a string
that is <span><strong>longer</strong></span> than it and there is at
least one domain element that is mapped to a string that is
<span><strong>shorter</strong></span> than it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Give a high-level description of a Turing machine that computes
this function.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the state diagram of this Turing machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, or C++ (or another
programming language of your choosing) that simulates the computations
of this Turing machine. Your program should display a snapshot of each
step of the computation, including the state of the machine, the current
(non-blank) contents of the tape, and the location of the read/write
head of the Turing machine. If you would like, you may use aids such as
co-pilot or ChatGPT to help you write this program. However, you should
test the code that is produced and be able to explain what it is doing.
As a header in your code file, include a comment block describing any
resources that were used to help generate your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your program on a string over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> which the function maps to a
string that is longer than it, and</p></li>
<li><p>Run your program on a string over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> which the function maps to a
string that is shorter than it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. To
demonstrate your work, you will create a 3-5 minute screencast video
with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the function you will be working with. Your video should
include a clear and precise definition of the function (before you
introduce any Turing machines).</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the high-level description of your
Turing machine witnessing that your function is computable.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the state diagram of your Turing
machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and present your code, including the software
design choices you made (e.g. which data structures are you using, etc.)
and any resources you used.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate running your code on the two example input strings
specified above. Explain why the output of your program is what you
would expect.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="grading-criteria-and-checklists-1">Grading
criteria and checklists</h3>
<p>Logistics: video loads correctly, is between 3 and 5 minutes, shows
the student’s face and ID, and they introduce themself audibly while on
screen.</p>
<p>The video clearly states which function was chosen for study, the
function which is well-defined and computable, the video presents the
two different descriptions of the Turing machine clearly, and the Turing
machine correctly computes the function.</p>
<p>The video clearly describes which programming language was chosen for
the implementation and gives the reasons why.</p>
<p>The video discusses the connections between the state diagram of the
Turing machine and its implementation in the code.</p>
<p>The video clearly demonstrates all test cases, including both
expected and actual output. The video should include screencasts of
running the code live to demonstrate these test cases.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-video">Your video:</h3>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>

<p>The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is

<p>Please send an email to the instructors (minnes@ucsd.edu and
dgrier@ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
