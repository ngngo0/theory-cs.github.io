<h1 class="title">HW1 : Regular Expressions and Deterministic Finite
Automata</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Due: : 4/7/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and automata. You will
use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of DFA, and
you will use clear English to describe computations of DFA
informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 1. We
will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.18,
1.23.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “HW1CSE105Sp22”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)
For <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a set of strings over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, we can define the
following associated sets <span class="math display">\[LZ(L) = \{ 0^k w
\mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z}, k \geq 0 \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[TZ(L) = \{ w 0^k \mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z},
k \geq 0 \}\]</span></p>
<p>Note: the commas in the set-builder definition indicate “and”.</p>
<p>Note: <span class="math inline">\(0^k\)</span> is the result of
concatenating <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with itself <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> times; it is the string of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s.</p>
<p>Note: Formally, <span class="math inline">\(LZ\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(TZ\)</span> are each functions, with domain the
set of languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and
with codomain the set of languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specify an example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L_1) = \Sigma^*\)</span>, or explain why there
is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and a precise and clear description
of the result of computing <span class="math inline">\(LZ(L_1)\)</span>
using the definitions to justify this description and justifying the set
equality with <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L_2)\)</span> is a finite set, or explain why
there is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and a precise and clear description
of the result of computing <span class="math inline">\(LZ(L_2)\)</span>
using the definitions to justify this description and justifying why it
is finite, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument why there
is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L_3) = TZ(L_3)\)</span>, or explain why there
is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> and a precise and clear description
of the results of computing <span class="math inline">\(LZ(L_3)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(TZ(L_3)\)</span> using the definitions
to justify this description and justifying the set equality, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the two
regular expressions over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{ 0, 1
\}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[R_1 = (~(000 \cup 111)^* ~\cup~
(01)^*~)
\qquad \qquad
R_2 = (~(000)^*(111)^* (\varepsilon \cup 0\cup1))\]</span> You will
prove that <span class="math display">\[L(R_1) \not \subseteq L(R_2) ~
\text{and} ~ L(R_2) \not \subseteq L(R_1)  
~ \text{and} ~ L(R_1) \cap L(R_2)  \neq \emptyset
~ \text{and} ~ L(R_1) \cup L(R_2)  \neq \Sigma^*\]</span> by giving four
example strings that witness these properties.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specify an example string <span
class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_1 \in L(R_1) \cap L(R_2)\)</span>. Briefly
justify your choice, referring to the definitions of the regular
expressions and their semantics.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example string <span
class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_2 \in L(R_1) \cap \overline{L(R_2)}\)</span>.
Briefly justify your choice, referring to the definitions of the regular
expressions and their semantics.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example string <span
class="math inline">\(w_3\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_3 \in \overline{L(R_1)} \cap L(R_2)\)</span>.
Briefly justify your choice, referring to the definitions of the regular
expressions and their semantics.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example string <span
class="math inline">\(w_4\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_4 \in \overline{L(R_1)} \cap
\overline{L(R_2)}\)</span>. Briefly justify your choice, referring to
the definitions of the regular expressions and their semantics.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a four letter alphabet (a nonempty finite set), and specify
it, e.g. by filling in the blank <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma
=  \underline{\text{fill in your alphabet here}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, pick a language of cardinality (size) <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> over this alphabet, and specify it,
e.g. by filling in the blank <span class="math display">\[L
=  \underline{\text{fill in your language here}}\]</span>
<span><em>Note: we encourage you to pay attention to syntax here. There
are many correct answers; please be precise in how you present the sets
you choose.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Give a regular expression that describes the language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> you defined in part (a). Briefly
justify why your regular expression works.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a DFA that recognizes your language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> you defined in part (a). Specify your
DFA <span><strong>both</strong></span> using a formal definition
<span><strong>and</strong></span> a state diagram. Briefly justify why
your DFA works.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the DFA
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> given by the state diagram
below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../resources/machines/hw1dfaCSE105Sp22.png"
style="width:3in" alt="State diagram for DFA C" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">State diagram for DFA <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Suppose someone tells you that the formal definition of this DFA is
<span class="math display">\[(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F) =  (\{ q0, q1,
q2, q3, q4, q5 \}, \{0,1,2\}, \delta, q0, q0)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[\hspace{-1in}\delta ( (q, 0) ) =
\begin{cases}
q5 &amp; \text{if $q=q0$} \\
qj &amp; \text{if $q=qi$ and $i \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $j=i+1$} \\
q &amp; \text{if $q \in \{q4,q5\}$} \\
\end{cases}  \qquad \delta ( (q, 1) ) = \begin{cases}
    q1 &amp; \text{if $q=q0$} \\
    q5 &amp; \text{if $q \in \{q1,q4,q5\}$} \\
    \delta( (q,0) ) &amp; \text{if $q=q2$ or $q=q3$} \\
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Confirm that this formal description is correct (in that it is
consistent with the state diagram), or fix any and all mistakes in it.
In your solution, explicitly address whether the description of the set
of states is correct, whether the description of the alphabet is
correct, whether the description of the transition function is correct,
whether the description of the start state is correct, and whether the
description of the accept states is correct, and why.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the set of accept states of this state diagram to get a
different DFA (with the same set of states, alphabet, start state, and
transition function) that recognizes an infinite language. Your solution
should include the diagram of this new DFA and an explanation of why the
language it recognizes is infinite.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Which
of the following are valid descriptions using the terminology we have
used in class and in the book so far? For those that aren’t, explain
what’s wrong. For those that are, give an example of what’s being
described.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A finite automaton accepts a regular expression.</p></li>
<li><p>The language described by a regular expression is a finite
automaton.</p></li>
<li><p>The empty string is the language of some regular
expression.</p></li>
<li><p>A string of length one uses one symbol from the
alphabet.</p></li>
<li><p>The input string runs a finite automaton.</p></li>
