<h1 class="title">HW6 : Computational Problems, Recognizability,
Decidability</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp23</p>
<p class="date">Due: May 23th at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><strong>In this assignment:</strong> You will use general
constructions and specific machines to explore the classes of
recognizable and decidable languages. You will explore various ways to
encode machines as strings so that computational problems can be
recognized.</p>
<p><em>Resources</em>: To review the topics you are working with for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 6 through Week 7. We
will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><em>Reading and extra practice problems</em>: Chapter 4 exercises
4.1, 4.3, 4.4., 4.5. Chapter 4 Problems 4.29, 4.30.</p>
<p><em>Key Concepts:</em> uring-recognizable languages, Turing-decidable
languages, Church-Turing thesis, computational problems.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The lowest HW score
will not be included in your overall HW average. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on HW
with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions about a
HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private post
(visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions (aligned with the textbook) and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw6CSE105Sp23”.</p>
<p><strong>Assigned questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Explicit encodings</strong> (8 points):<br />
In a computational problem, the elements of the language are encodings
of machines. For example, consider the language <span
class="math display">\[E_{\mathrm{DFA}} := \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M
\text{ is a DFA, and } L(M) = \varnothing \}\]</span> where each string
<span class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle\)</span> in the language
encodes a DFA <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0,
F)\)</span>. Usually, we purposefully drop the details about how this
encoding is done because they can distract from the central
computational properties of the language. In fact, any encoding can be
used so long as there exists a decider for syntactic questions about the
DFAs being encoded. In this question, we will build some specific
explicit examples of encodings of DFAs to get more comfortable with
these ideas.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
<em>Encoding with delimiters:</em> Perhaps the most straightforward way
to create an encoding is to have it mirror the structure of the tuple
<span class="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> for the
DFA. Your task: describe an encoding that maps each DFA <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to a distinct string <span
class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle\)</span> that uniquely
identifies <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. That is, if you
“decode” the encoding, you get the exact same machine back.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use special characters like <span
class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\$\)</span> as delimiters in your encoding to
separate the various components.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Your encoding alphabet must be finite</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Use your encoding
from part (a) to produce the string encoding the DFA below:</p>
<div class="center">

</div></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Show that it is
possible to have the same kind of delimited encoding without using
special delimiter characters. In particular, prove that for every DFA
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we can assume that <span
class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle \subseteq
\{0,1\}^*\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Challenge; not graded:For the delimited encoding schemes above,
there are strings over the encoding alphabet (<span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) that nevertheless do not
correspond to a valid DFA. Prove/disprove: There exists an encoding
scheme for which this is not true; that is, <span
class="math display">\[\{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \text{ is a DFA}\} =
\Sigma^*.\]</span></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Closure</strong> (18 points):<br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \{0,1,2\}\)</span>. Recall the functions
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \textsc{Substring}(K) &amp;:= \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{there
exist } a,b \in \Gamma^* \text{ such that } awb \in K\} \\
    \textsc{Rep}(L) &amp;:= \{ w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{between every
    pair of successive $2$s in $w$ is a string in $L$}\}\\
    &amp;\phantom{:}=\{w \in \Gamma^* \mid \text{for all } v \in
\Sigma^* \text{ if } 2v2 \in \textsc{Substring}(\{w\})  \text{, then } v
\in L\}
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Prove that, given any deterministic decider over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(M_L\)</span>, there is a deterministic decider
over <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> that recognizes <span
class="math display">\[\textsc{Rep}(~L(M_L)~)\]</span> In other words,
you will prove that for any Turing-decidable language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Rep}(L)\)</span> is also Turing-decidable.
A complete answer will include both a precise construction of the
machine and a (brief) justification of why this machine works as
required.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that, given
any nondeterministic Turing machine over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(N_L\)</span>, there is a nondeterministic Turing
machine over <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> that recognizes
<span class="math display">\[\textsc{Substring}(~L(N_L)~)\]</span> In
other words, you will prove that the class of Turing-recognizable
languages over <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is closed
under the <span class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}\)</span>
operation. A complete answer will include both a precise construction of
the machine and a (brief) justification of why this machine works as
required.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give a different
proof that the class of Turing-recognizable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(\textsc{Substring}\)</span> operation, this time
using only deterministic Turing machines. A complete answer will include
both a precise construction of the machine and a (brief) justification
of why this machine works as required.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational problems</strong> (24 points):<br />
For each of the following statements, determine if it is true or false.
Clearly label your choice by starting your solution with
<span><strong>True</strong></span> or
<span><strong>False</strong></span> and then provide a brief (3-4
sentences or so) justification for your answer.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) For each regular
language <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the language <span

L(M_1) \subseteq L \text{ and } L(M_2) \subseteq \overline{L}\}\]</span>
is decidable.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Model} \in \{\mathrm{DFA}, \mathrm{NFA},
