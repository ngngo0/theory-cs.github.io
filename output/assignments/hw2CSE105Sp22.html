<h1 class="title">HW2 : Regular Languages and Automata
Constructions</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Due: : 4/14/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing multiple representations of regular
languages and working with general constructions of automata to
demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 1 and
the start of Week 2. We will post frequently asked questions and our
answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. Chapter 1 exercises 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21,
1.22.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key Concepts</strong></span>: Regular expressions,
language described by a regular expression, deterministic finite
automata (DFAs), regular languages, closure of the class of regular
languages under certain operations, nondeterministic finite automata
(NFA).</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “HW2CSE105Sp22”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)
Over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span>, consider
the language <span class="math display">\[L = \{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid
(ab \textrm{ is a substring of $w$}) \land (ba \textrm{ is a substring
of $w$})
    \land (w \textrm{ starts with } a)\}\]</span> In this question, you
will use two different approaches to proving that this language is
regular by building (different) DFA that recognize this language.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Design a DFA recognizing the language <span
class="math inline">\(\{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid ab \textrm{ is a substring
of $w$}\}\)</span> and a DFA recognizing the language <span
class="math inline">\(\{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid ba \textrm{ is a substring
of $w$}\}\)</span> and a third DFA recognizing the language <span
class="math inline">\(\{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w \textrm{ starts with }
a\}\)</span>. Then, use the construction we discussed in class to
combine these DFA to get a DFA that recognizes <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. A complete solution will include the
(clearly labelled) state diagrams for each of the three building-block
DFAs, along with a description of the result of combining these DFAs
that includes the formal definition of the resulting DFA and at the
least the part of the state diagram that includes the start state, all
the outgoing edges from the start state, and specifies how many states
the full DFA will have.</p></li>
<li><p>Rewrite the language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> in a
simpler form and use this simpler form to design a DFA with at most
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> states that recognizes <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. A complete solution will include the
complete state diagram of this DFA and a justification for why the DFA
recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>To safeguard the privacy or security of a network, some software
filters the IP addresses that are allowed to send content to computers
on the network. Each IP address can be broken into parts that represent
the source host of incoming traffic, including geographic data. As a
result, software needs to be designed to recognize whether certain
substrings (representing permitted hosts) are present (if the hosts are
permitted to send data) and whether others are absent (if those hosts
are blocked from sending data).</p>
<p>In this question, you’ll design ways to detect these patterns in
strings.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\)</span> design a
DFA that accepts each and only strings that have <span
class="math inline">\(384\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(116\)</span> as a substring. Your DFA should have
<span><strong>no more than <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>
states</strong></span>. A complete solution will include the state
diagram of your DFA and a brief justification of your construction by
explaining the role each state plays in the machine. <span><em>Note: you
may include the formal definition of your DFA, but this is not
required.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Now suppose the
network administrators want to block traffic from IP addresses that have
been associated with spammers. Over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\)</span>, design an NFA
with at most <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> states that accepts
each and only strings that do not have the substring <span
class="math inline">\(384\)</span> and do not have the substring <span
class="math inline">\(116\)</span>. A complete solution will include the
state diagram of your NFA and a brief justification of your construction
by explaining the role each state plays in the machine.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>) Give a regular expression that
describes the set of strings over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\)</span> that have <span
class="math inline">\(384\)</span> as a substring and give a (different)
regular expression that describes the set of strings over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\)</span> that do not
have <span class="math inline">\(384\)</span> as a substring. Briefly
justify why each of your regular expression works.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In this question, you’ll practice working with formal general
constructions for DFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal
definitions. Consider the following construction in the textbook for
Chapter 1 Problem 34, which we include here for reference: “Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{ 0,1\}\)</span>. Define <span
class="math display">\[B \overset{1}{\leftarrow} C= \{ w \in B
~\mid~\textrm{ for some $y \in C$, strings $w$ and $y$ contain equal
numbers of $1$s }\}\]</span> The class of regular languages is shown to
be closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(\overset{1}{\leftarrow}\)</span> operation using
the construction: Let <span class="math inline">\(M_B = (Q_B, \Sigma,
\delta_B, q_B, F_B)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_C = (
Q_C, \Sigma, \delta_C, q_C, F_C)\)</span> be DFAs recognizing the
languages <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, respectively. We will now construct
NFA <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(B \overset{1}{\leftarrow}
C\)</span> as follows. To decide whether its input <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(B
\overset{1}{\leftarrow} C\)</span>, the machine <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> checks that <span
class="math inline">\(w \in B\)</span>, and in parallel
nondeterministically guesses a string <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that contains the same number of <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s as contained in <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and checks that <span
class="math inline">\(y \in C\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q = Q_B \times Q_C\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\((q,r) \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a \in \Sigma_\varepsilon\)</span>, define <span
class="math display">\[\delta( ~((q,r), a)~) = \begin{cases}
\{ (\delta_B(q,0) , r ) \}  \qquad&amp;\textrm{if } a = 0 \\
\{ (\delta_B( q,1) ,  \delta_C( r,1) ) \}  \qquad&amp;\textrm{if } a = 1
\\
\{ (q, \delta_C( r,0 ))\}  \qquad&amp;\textrm{if } a = \varepsilon\\
\end{cases}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(q_0 = (q_B, q_C)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(F = F_B \times
F_C\)</span>   ."</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this
construction by defining specific example DFAs <span
class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_C\)</span> and including their state diagrams in
your submission. Choose <span class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> to have
four states and <span class="math inline">\(M_C\)</span> to have two
states, and make sure that every state in each state diagram is
reachable from the start state of that machine. Apply the construction
above to create the NFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and
include its state diagram in your submission. <span><em>Note: you may
include the formal definition of your DFAs and NFA, but this is not
required.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Hint: Confirm that you have specified every required piece
of the state diagram for <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. E.g.,
label the states consistently with the construction, indicate the start
arrow, specify each accepting state, and include all required
transitions.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>)
Describe the sets recognized by each of the machines you used in part
(a): <span class="math inline">\(M_B, M_C, M\)</span>. If possible, give
an example of a string that is in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
and in <span class="math inline">\(B \overset{1}{\leftarrow} C\)</span>
and an example of a string that is in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and not in <span
class="math inline">\(B \overset{1}{\leftarrow} C\)</span>. If any of
these examples do not exist, explain why not.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) In
last week’s homework, we saw the definitions of two functions on the set
of languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>: for
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a set of strings over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, we can define the
following associated sets <span class="math display">\[LZ(L) = \{ 0^k w
\mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z}, k \geq 0 \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[TZ(L) = \{ w 0^k \mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z},
k \geq 0 \}\]</span> In this question, we’ll develop a general
construction that will prove that if <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular then so are <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(TZ(L)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider an arbitrary regular language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, and we are given that
<span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> is
a DFA over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(M) = L\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Give the formal construction of an NFA <span
class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(M&#39;) = LZ(L)\)</span>. Briefly justify each
parameter in the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply your construction from part (a) when <span
class="math inline">\(L_{test} = L(M_{test})\)</span>, where the state
diagram <span class="math inline">\(M_{test}\)</span> is below. Submit
the state diagram of the NFA that results. If possible, give an example
of a string that is in <span class="math inline">\(LZ(L_{test})\)</span>
and one that is not; if either of these examples do not exist, explain
why not.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the formal construction of an NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N&#39;\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(N&#39;) = TZ(L)\)</span>. Briefly justify each
parameter in the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(N&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply your construction from part (c) when <span
class="math inline">\(L_{test} = L(M_{test})\)</span>, where the state
diagram <span class="math inline">\(M_{test}\)</span> is below. Submit
the state diagram of the NFA that results. If possible, give an example
of a string that is in <span class="math inline">\(TZ(L_{test})\)</span>
and one that is not; if either of these examples do not exist, explain
why not.</p>
